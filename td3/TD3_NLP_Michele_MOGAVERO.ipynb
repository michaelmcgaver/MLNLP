' the incident took place on june 11 , 2014 , when the dog was seen being dragged along the b1006 behind the car . tree surgeons working nearby spotted what had happened and tried to get fuller , who is a rhodesian ridgeback breeder and exhibitor , to stop her car . she did n't stop until she reached the end of the carriageway and they took her registration number and reported her to police who called the rspca , the court heard . tango was later found by inspectors in an outbuilding at fuller 's home with bandages on his paws . he was taken to a vet and given treatment for his injuries , which took eight weeks . tango was left with considerable injuries to his paws and stomach , as well as a deep elbow wound tango , a rhodesian ridgeback , pictured before being injured by being dragged along the road fuller claimed she had not been aware the rear hatch of her car had opened and claimed she had given the one-year-old dog first aid , and had already arranged for him to go to the vet when police turned up . mike fullerton , defending fuller , said : ` when deborah fuller was being restrained she asked why she was not allowed to take the dog to the vet . ' rspca inspector sam garvey said after the sentencing : ` eyewitnesses report they saw the dog being dragged about 400 metres at a speed of 30mph . ` this must have been horrific for poor tango . so painful , and so distressing . ` it is hard to say what caused tango to be dragged behind a moving car in this way , but by the time we found him , seven hours later , he was urgently in need of vet treatment . the animal was taken to the vets and treated for the burns , suffered when he was dragged along the road judges ruled that the dog 's suffering could have been avoided if fuller had taken him to the vets earlier ` he had injuries to the pads of all four feet , causing the black layer of skin to be removed . he also had grazing to his chest area and a nasty deep wound to his elbow and leg area . ` it took a period of eight weeks to heal the wounds and for his skin to grow back over his pads so he could walk without discomfort . ' fuller was also ordered to pay # 3,000 costs , given a 12 month community order and a two month curfew from 7pm to 7am . tango was taken to a vet for treatment after being found and has made a full recovery in foster care . the court also allowed confiscation of all the animals owned by fuller , which are currently in rspca care . tango was removed from fuller , along with more than 40 other dogs that were at her essex home fuller and her partner phil sheldrake , 59 , previously pleaded guilty to 16 charges of causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the dogs ' needs at colchester magistrates court in june . earlier this month the case was thrown out after the high court ruled that inspectors did have the correct warrant to seize 44 dogs from their essex home . tendring district council had been granted a warrant to investigate ` nuisance ' at the house , following complaints about noise and dog faeces . the council joined forces with the rspca and seized 44 dogs from the house , with the animal welfare charity claiming several of the animals were emaciated . however the trial was halted when district judge kenneth sheraton said evidence gathered by inspectors was inadmissible because they did not have the correct warrant .\n",

            "millionaire real estate heir robert durst has pleaded not guilty to two weapons charges related to his arrest last month , further delaying his extradition to california to face murder charges . durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a new orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug , marijuana . durst 's hands were shackled to his sides , and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium . unlikely to face charges in california anytime soon : robert durst , 71 , pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges . durst is pictured here last month in new orleans attorney dick deguerin whispered into durst 's ear as he entered the plea . he had to whisper twice before durst said , ' i am not guilty , your honor . ' judge franz zibilich asked if durst was making that plea to both charges against him . deguerin whispered again , and durst said , ` yes , your honor . ' the weapons arrest has kept durst in new orleans even though he waived extradition to california , where he 's charged in the december 2000 death of a longtime friend . durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison . durst 's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in new orleans . an affidavit filed there accuses durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms . prosecutors have asked a u.s. magistrate judge to order durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next thursday -- and that he remain in u.s. custody until the federal matter is resolved . durst , an estranged member of the family that runs 1 world trade center in new york , has had multiple run-ins with the law over his nearly 72 years . he was arrested in new orleans last month on the eve of the finale of a six-part hbo documentary called ` the jinx ' about durst , the disappearance of his first wife in 1982 , the death of a longtime friend in 2000 and the death and dismemberment of a neighbor in galveston in 2001 . murdered : susan berman , who acted as a media spokesperson for durst in the wake of his wife 's disappearance , was shot in the head at her la home in 2000 , just as the cold case into the disappearance of kathleen durst was reopened . durst was charged with berman 's murder last month a self-defense plea won acquittal in the death of morris black , but durst is charged in los angeles with murder in the death of longtime friend susan berman , 55 , who was shot in the head in 2000 . berman , an author , acted as a media spokesperson for durst in the wake of his wife 's disappearance . the jinx suggested she knew a lot about durst . her death coincided with the cold case of kathleen durst 's disappearance being reopened . durst 's lawyers , deguerin and billy gibbens , have said repeatedly that he just wants to go to california to deal with that charge . they also have challenged the weapons charges on several grounds , including the allegation that the fbi ` rummaged ' through durst 's belongings before getting an arrest or search warrant . but andrea armstrong , a criminal law professor at loyola university in new orleans , said wednesday that ` the fact that it was warrantless does n't necessarily mean it was unconstitutional . ' there are at least 11 circumstances , starting with consent , that make it legal to search without a warrant , she said . deguerin also has argued that the two felonies to which durst pleaded guilty in pennsylvania -- possessing a firearm while a fugitive and doing so while under indictment -- are not among those that would make it illegal for him to have a gun . until his indictment wednesday , durst had been arrested but not formally charged in connection with the .38 - caliber revolver authorities say was found in his room at the j.w. marriott , where he was staying under the name everette ward . according to court testimony , an fbi agent recognized durst in a new orleans hotel march 14 and escorted him to his hotel room . durst was arrested early march 15 on the los angeles warrant and arrested separately on the weapons charges the next day . durst 's lawyers say the arrest in new orleans was timed to coincide with the final episode of ` the jinx , ' which also described the disappearance of his wife , kathleen , in 1982 from new york ; the los angeles shooting of berman , 55 , in 2000 ; and black 's death in 2001 .\n",

            "johnny manziel was spotted for the first time since being released from rehab . the footballer checked into a facility on january 28 after stating that he wanted to ` be a better family member , friend and teammate , ' and tuesday night the cleveland browns quarterback was seen enjoying a texas rangers game with girlfriend colleen crowley . he also stayed away from the booze , sipping water throughout the game . this as offseason workouts with the team will begin next monday , april 20 . johnny manziel was spotted at a texas rangers game tuesday night days after leaving rehab he was joined by his girlfriend colleen crowley and sipped water throughout the night manziel ( above ) has been released from rehab after entering a facility on january 28 this after manziel 's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last july , with some worried his drinking was a priority according to espn , manziel was ` doing great ' in rehab , and had the full support of his team . now comes the real test however , as he will be forced to compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position , who just signed a $ 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons . this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the cleveland browns season last december , but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem . especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , manziel , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the browns . manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior , saying ; ` it 's about being accountable ... instead of looking like a jackass . ' and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday , alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano . at this point , some in the sports world , chief among them columnist skip bayless , began to suggest that the heisman trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking . the aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released appearing on espn 's first take , bayless , a noted supporter of manziel , did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking . ` my concern , i repeatedly said , was if johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol , and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails , then i 'm going to be out , ' said bayless . ` in talking to people in and around the cleveland browns , i believe johnny manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol . and i believe ... that it is time for johnny to get some help . he continues to lie to his executives , to his coaches , to his teammates , to the media , and most of all , he continues to lie to himself . ' he then said he would label manziel an ` alcoholic . ' manziel was known for his partying while at texas a&m , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl draft , noting that he had ` grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland . just days into his training with the browns however , the local press began calling him out on his partying , which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field . a source told cleveland.com at the time ; ` team officials had bought into manziel 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in college station , texas , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics . ' a photo snapped of manziel before the start of the season and later posted to instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas a&m university aggies also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of manziel and later posted to instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine . browns head coach mike pettine spoke to manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted , a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the nfl , and said he felt that things were back on track and that manziel was focused on football once again . there was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building , and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident , it was the fan who was inebriated , not manziel . it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by espn in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college , manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem , seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks . manziel would later claim this report was false , and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college . manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the cleveland browns on april 20 as for his future with the browns , that is a little unclear . some , including espn 's pat mcmanamon , have called on the browns to fire manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year , saying he and fellow player josh gordon have a ` complete lack of professionalism . ' gordon was also out with manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through , an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season . currently , manziel has a four year contract with the browns worth about $ 8.25 million . the 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted , and lucrative , endorsement deals in the sports world with , among others , nike , mcdonald 's , musclepharm , and snickers . for now though , manziel seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football . ` when [ manziel ] is back , it will be full speed ahead for him , said pettine . ' i think he 's very anxious at this point . we 'll be prepared as we will with every other player . when they get back to town , we 're going to coach the heck out of them . '\n",

' it 's now listed on ebay for # 120,000 which is 100 times what they originally bought it for , but it 's not just a bus , it 's a piece of british history , listed as ` the soul survivor ' of the original fleet . it 's one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the ministry of technology in 1967 , to promote british industry as a global leader by visiting factories to show films about modernisation . with a plastic perspex bubble at the front and a tardis-like interior with a 26-seater cinema inside , the bedford sb3 looked like something from the future as they toured the country promoting the ` white heat of technology ' . the vintage mobile cinema is one of just seven mobile cinemas originally commissioned by the ministry of technology in 1967 a piece of history : this was how the buses were advertised when they toured factories to promote british industry in the 1960s super seven : the vintage is the soul survivor of a fleet of seven and was rescued from a field in essex where it sat for 14 years promoting industry : bosses and workers at factories would enter the visiting bus to learn about the ` white heat of technology ' but like all modern creations , soon enough they grew old and it was n't long before this particular cinema was on the road to being forgotten . it was owned by the transport trust between 1975 and 1990 but after that it sat in a field in essex for 14 years until it was rescued by a previous owner based in somerset . in 2005 , ollie halls and emma giffard of the vintage mobile cinema company bought it for just # 1,200 and brought it to devon , where they carefully restored it with the help of friends . they spent # 35,000 on the restoration which put the vintage cinema back on the road and touring a series of shows at north devon schools and villages and beyond . from there it went on to exhibit at film festivals , community , corporate and private events around the uk and abroad , travelling as far as holland and france . listed : the rare bedford mobile cinema was fully restored between 2005 and 2010 and is now on offer on ebay for # 120,000 oliver and emma are hoping that someone else might take up the mantle and continue touring the bus but at this point the future of the cinema is uncertain . ollie said : ` it could go any which way - a collector in this country or abroad , someone wanting to run the business , or a group putting together a bid to bring it into a trust . ' i really want it to continue to be out there for people to be able to carry on sharing the experience . ` but we have to decide what route is going to best secure its future , because it 's completely unique and owning it means that we 're custodians of that little bit of history . government property : the fleet of bedford sb3s as they were when they toured the country promoting industry in the 1960s ` it was never meant to be a career - i just started doing it up as a hobby and it got out of control . ' i was working full time and spending all my spare time and spare money on the bus , lying in the mud in a freezing cold shed wondering if i 'd gone mad . ` but people just loved everything about it , which made all the blood , sweat and tears worthwhile . ` they do n't make things like this anymore , and it speaks to people 's sense of nostalgia . ` it was so popular that it absolutely and 100 per cent took over my life - and it 's been hard to give up to because so many people still want the bus . ' there 's also a new edition which could be a different opportunity to a new owner . the vehicles originally towed huge exhibition trailers and remarkably the cinema has now been reunited with its trailer - after being separated for 23 years . re-united : the owners got a call ` out of the blue ' from someone who knew where the buses trailer was after they had been separated for 23 years . now the pair have come together again - but the trailer is a restoration project in itself for the new owner ` we got a phone call out the blue , ' said ollie . ` someone saw us on the news and realised that the trailer their friend had been using as a woodwork shop belonged with our cinema . ` it 's taken a few years but we 've finally put them back together . ' ollie had been promised the trailer from an owner sympathetic to their project around four years ago but when he finally got it , it 's actually what convinced the family to part with the bus . ` it 's a huge restoration which i do n't think i want to do because i have a number of other projects that i 'm hoping to work on . ` we 've just bought our first house in somerset which is a restoration project and i 've also got a 1940s caravan and another 1960s bedford truck to work on . ` i 'm the kind of guy who likes a challenge but i feel like the bus is done now and i want to work on something new - i 've been doing it most of my adult life . ` they drive beautifully together but the trailer is another restoration project - maybe this time for someone else . ' mod cons : inside the cinema is far from vintage with a full hd projector and dolby surround sound the vintage piece is advertised as the ` only surviving ' member of a fleet of seven and has 26 1930s-style seats - as well as a few modern tweaks . the projection kit is full hd , with a 7.1 dolby surround sound , complemented by sound proofing fitted to ` limit external disturbances ' . there 's also climate control , delivering hot and cold air ` for the comfort of the audience ' ollie and emma hope that the cinema will remain in use for the people of britain to enjoy . and although the price-tag is high , potential buyers wo n't get another opportunity to buy this piece of british history . ` it 's one of a kind , ' emma said . ` it 's a once in a lifetime opportunity for someone .

who wears expensive boots , jeans , a baseball jacket , sunglasses and gold chains - gives the thumbs up to the camera while standing in front of the burning rubble of a destroyed building . elsewhere in the video the rapper wears military-style fatigues , although his well-groomed beard and spotless white trainers make him stand out among the exhausted fighters wearing bullet-proof vests and battered combat gear . although he appears in the war zone wielding a guns , it is not clear whether volcano is simply using the civil war backdrop for effect or if he is actually involved in the conflict . it is also unclear whether the fighters he appears alongside are rebels or members of the libyan national army . costume changes : volcano alternates between wearing expensive boots , jeans , a baseball jacket , sunglasses and gold chains ( left ) and military-style fatigues ( right ) . his well-groomed beard and spotless white trainers make him stand out among the exhausted-looking fighters he surrounds himself with , however it is not clear whether volcano is using the civil war backdrop for effect , or if he is involved in the conflict the most senior member of the gaddafi clan has laid the blame of the migrant shipwreck that killed about 950 people on the western countries which helped overthrow colonel gaddafi . ahmed gaddaf al-dam , a former minister and muammar gaddafi 's cousin , said the ` overwhelming chaos ' in libya ` has become a shame that will haunt the countries that had participated in the destruction of the libyan armed forces in 2011 ' . but senior conservative minister william hague has defended the government 's role in helping to overthrow the dictator , who was well-known for his barbaric treatment of the would-be migrants . about 800 people are believed to have died when a fishing boat carrying migrants overturned off libyan waters , south of the italian island of lampedusa , shortly after midnight on sunday . and gaddafi 's cousin , who was one of several high-profile regime figures who fled to egypt during the 2011 revolution , believes the only solution for stability in the mediterranean is to bring back those who surrounded the country 's despotic former ruler in government . volcano 's facebook page describes him as a benghazi-based rapper who also studies english translation at benghazi university - the oldest education establishment in libya . the lyrics to his song refer to god being ` gone ' and - rather than talking about the conflict in libya - appear about palestinians living in gaza . the refrain of the song suggests volcano keeps up to date with events in the gaza strip and israel via news on google and yahoo . giving his personal interests as ` libyan rap ' , volcano 's page also states : ' i hate treason ' . the comment is not elaborated on , and it is not clear exactly what he is referring to . the majority of volcano 's music video is filmed on an hd camera and he appears to be wearing and large and expensive wristwatch throughout -

' according to a close friend of kate 's : ` she ca n't wait to escape the hustle and bustle of the city . both she and william love the country and it 's where they want to raise their family . ' it 's not hard to see why they want to escape the confines of apartment 1a , kensington palace , their official residence . fiercely private , the cambridges are faced with the problem of being both public figures and private people . william has a complicated relationship with the media , dating back to his mother 's tragic death . he despises the paparazzi and has threatened legal action against any individuals taking unofficial photographs of his family . pregnant kate and young prince george have enjoyed meeting the new-born animals at snettisham park farm prince george and his mother are also regular visitors to the children 's play area at a nearby village as a result , prince george is rarely photographed in public and has not made an official appearance in this country since leaving st mary 's hospital 21 months ago . it is part of william 's strategy to shelter his family and he has a team of qualified aides and lawyers to advise him on privacy laws . of course , william and kate are also keen to enjoy the fruits of their two-year # 1.5 million remodelling of their new home , with its ten bedrooms , swimming pool , tennis court and extensive grounds . their official residence will remain kensington palace , but anmer hall will be their de facto family home for at least the next two years as william embarks on a new career with the east anglian air ambulance service . as part of the costly renovations -- which also included installing a new roof , a state-of-the-art kitchen and a conservatory -- william had the driveway to the property , which used to belong to his close friends the van cutsem family , rerouted so that anyone accessing the property is shielded by trees . security is paramount and the outhouses have been converted into dwellings for the couple 's security staff . at anmer hall , prince george can enjoy playing in the garden and william can cycle freely around the country lanes . kate loves shopping in the locals villages of burnham market , holt and holkham and locals often see her playing with george at a play area in a nearby village . moving to anmer has afforded the couple the peace and freedom william especially has always craved . the tiny hamlet where they live is so small there is n't even a pub , just a social club where the couple sometimes mingle with locals at its film nights . the residents of the blue-doored cottages , part of the sandringham estate , are fiercely protective of their new neighbours . remember , too , that some of william 's happiest childhood memories are of when his mother ripped up the stuffy royal protocols and introduced her two young sons to ` normal ' life by taking them to theme parks , go-kart tracks and public beaches -- trips echoed by kate and george 's visit to the petting zoo . the duchess of cambridge enjoys shopping in picturesque north norfolk villages such as holt ( pictured ) friends say they are considering sending prince george to a local nursery or playschool . while a royal aide says it is ` a bit premature ' , the couple will soon have to think about the option for their son . the couple have already become central to the elite group of aristocratic locals known as the ` turnip toffs ' . prince george 's godfather william van cutsem and his wife rosie live in hilborough , 40 minutes away , while the duke 's old friends the duckworth-chad family live at pynkney hall near king 's lynn . william 's friend , etonian archie soames is often at the family seat , west barsham hall in fakenham , less than an hour from anmer hall , and the couple socialise with baron howard of rising 's children annabel , charlie and tom who william plays football with . the duke 's cousin laura fellowes and her husband nick pettman also live in west norfolk . the couple already have a list of favourite pubs . two weeks ago , they shared a dinner with six friends at the crown in nearby east rudham . william , seated at the head of the table next to his heavily pregnant wife , organised the supper to celebrate them finally moving to anmer . ` william and kate have friends in norfolk , and they enjoyed a private dinner in a dining room , ' reports a source . ` they wanted a night out and they can do it here . the locals are very protective of them , as are the pub owners . they organise special tables out of the way of prying eyes and escape routes so they are never seen coming in or leaving . ' the couple have been seen dining at the dabbling duck in great massingham , the king 's head in great bircham and the rose and crown at snettisham . while they are relaxed , their discreet security detail of five protection officers remains on high alert . friends say the plan is for carole to move in to look after her daughter once william resumes work following a fortnight 's paternity leave . the duke , 32 , will be stationed at cambridge airport when he is fully trained to fly a powerful ec145 t2 helicopter . he is said to be ` enormously excited ' about flying again , but it will be a challenge juggling his new career with official duties . william will be based at cambridge airport as part of his duties with the east anglian air ambulance service the cambridges have already enjoyed dinner with friends at one of their locals , the crown inn at east rudham the mail on sunday has been told that william has implemented a number of changes to his diary and will be cutting back on black-tie charity events in particular . instead , a friend insisted , he plans to continue with the informal , more intimate charity work he loves . a spokesman for the duke said he remains committed to his charities , adding : ` the duke 's intent is to work as full time as possible . he starts flying in the summer and his roster will take into account his official engagements . these will be broadly consistent with previous years . ' meanwhile , his family will be staying in the background . princes william and harry were filmed as toddlers playing the piano in the kensington palace nursery with their parents , but william and kate have refused to allow the cameras into their home . pointedly , prince george fulfilled his only official engagement on the other side of the world in wellington during the couple 's tour of new zealand and australia . that short yet charming photocall has been his sole appearance in the public eye . diana strove to create as ordinary a life as possible for her boys and william wants the same for his own children . he has seen the charm , security and joys of a happy family life with the middletons and it is what he desires for his own family . both he and kate realise such a dream is far more realistic far from the madding crowds at anmer hall .\n",

            "( cnn ) the fbi has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the malaysian bomb maker known as marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the philippines in january . marwan , whose real name is zulkifli bin hir , was believed by the fbi to a member of southeast asian terror group jemaah islamiyah 's central command . the fbi said in february that a dna sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern philippines showed a link with a known relative of marwan . but the fbi now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted islamic extremist . \" after a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our philippine law enforcement partners , the fbi has assessed that terrorism subject , zulkifli abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the fbi 's list of most wanted terrorists , \" david bowdich , assistant director in charge of the fbi 's los angeles field office , told cnn in a statement . the fbi had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a california court . it accused him of being a supplier of ieds to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the philippines-based abu sayyaf . marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by philippine security forces in 2012 . the philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the moro islamic liberation front ( milf ) , the largest rebel group in the region . but in january it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of marwan at mamapasono , in the southern province of maguindanao . the mission went disastrously awry . forty-four members of the police 's elite special action force ( saf ) unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters ( biff ) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the philippines government . according to a report released by the institute for policy analysis of conflict ( ipac ) last month , the biff faction sheltering marwan had sworn allegiance to isis . in the immediate aftermath of the assault , the saf company charged with executing marwan came under fire , before another saf company stationed in nearby milf territory as a \" blocking force \" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with milf fighters . according to the ipac report , the saf \" blocking \" company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived , eighteen milf fighters were killed and a number of biff fighters may also died . the clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the milf , authorities said . a national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest . bowdich expressed the fbi 's \" sincere condolences to the brave officers of the special action force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive . \" while an saf superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the philippines . the ipac report argued that the \" single-minded focus \" of authorities on killing marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the milf , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the philippines congress . \" the best chance the southern philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , \" read the report , which argued that the mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing marwan . the report argued that , although marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to milf and abu sayyaf , he was not \" the master bomber that his reputation suggested . \" yet for the philippines authorities and their u.s. allies , killing marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the milf to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . the report quoted an anonymous indonesian associate of marwan 's who described the malaysian as \" a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon . \" read more : dozens of philippine police killed in raid on ` high value ' bomb makers read more : philippines honors 44 slain commandos with day of mourning cnn 's arlene samson-espiritu and kathy quiano contributed to this report .\n",

            "( cnn ) so now the real trial is underway : what does the surviving boston marathon bomber , dzhokhar tsarnaev , deserve and why ? what 's he likely to get and why ? let 's start where the penalty phase starts , with the prosecution 's case . prosecutors have listed , as they must , the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment . the killing was \" heinous , cruel and depraved . \" he placed a bomb in a crowd , set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that 's not heinous , cruel and depraved , what is ? cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims , or , at the opposite extreme , it reflects a cold , callous indifference . cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst . the number of dead from the bombing ( three ) and injured ( 260 ) , including dozens maimed , also elevate these murders . the victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old martin richard . for 2,500 years , we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable , yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy , and those who prey on them as especially culpable . the prosecution 's emphasis : the killings involved \" substantial planning and premeditation \" and a betrayal of the united states -- the very country that gave tsarnaev shelter and citizenship . and then there 's the selection of the site , the boston marathon , an \" iconic \" event . and then there 's tsarnaev 's lack of remorse -- opening day , the prosecutor 's final shot of tsarnaev locked up , giving the security camera the finger . from his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day , the message has been : screw you , society . tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy , but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse . and do n't confuse regret with remorse . no doubt tsarnaev regrets his present predicament , regrets the negative publicity he 's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape . but that 's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he 's killed and maimed . dzhokhar tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils , the defense will insist over and over . tamerlan was the source of his younger brother 's malicious intent . as the prisoners inside washington d.c. 's now defunct lorton central prison once described the street code to me : no snitching , but if someone dies , then \" the dead guy did everything . \" so the defense will claim that dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be . after all , he was only 19 . biologists teach us our brains do n't fully develop until we 're 25 . thus , their argument goes , a 19-year-old simply ca n't be the worst of the worst . in 2005 , the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed , repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists laurence steinberg and elizabeth scott . but in the same article , these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an \" open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults . \" and they were talking about 17-year-olds . to the best of my knowledge , science has not and can not establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility . think about it : when a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building , risking his life to save children inside , we celebrate this heroism . we do not , nor should we , dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality . if we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults , why ca n't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst ? what outcome would i predict in the tsarnaev case ? confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to \" move on , \" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits tsarnaev , i expect the jury will vote 10-2 ( or 9-3 ) for death . but they must be unanimous for death ; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence . worse , the historical record and headlines in the next day 's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim : \" jury chooses life for the marathon bomber \" -- even if overwhelmingly the people 's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment . requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many . because in the end , we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people . and yet , if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime , if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals , surely the boston marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst .\n",

' mathieson then grabbed two knives from a set of drawers before blocking the door . one of the women begged mathieson to let them go but he grabbed their mobile phones and flung them away , the court heard . he initially tormented them by stroking them with the knives before threatening to kill them if they did not follow his demands . miss farquharson : ` he told both to remove their clothing and to dance for him . ` in fear of what he might do and , with the body of the deceased lying on the bed in front of them , each did as they were told . ' mathieson went on to rape the pair , aged 26 and 22 - including attacking one after ordering her to lie beside ms maurer 's dead body . the pair were trapped in the bedroom for 10 minutes before he ordered them downstairs . once there , mathieson continued to humiliate them before raping them again . miss farquharson said : ` over the course of the assault in the living room , he told them that his son was asleep in the bedroom upstairs . ` he appeared to have an awareness of what he had done advising both : ` i 'm going to be many years in prison because i killed that girl . ` i 've done this to show my wife something . ' mathieson then went to a window thinking his partner had returned and , sensing an opportunity to escape , the women ran for the door . mathieson tried to chase them , striking one on the leg with a knife , but they managed to escape and ran to a nearby flat where a woman came to their aid . miss farquharson : ` both repeatedly stated their thanks and asked for help . they were crying and appeared to be terrified . ' after the women escaped , mathieson dialled 999 himself and told the operator : ` i 've been high on drugs and i 've killed a prostitute . ` tell the officers i am not aggressive . i 'm sitting on the couch . i had two other girls , but i 've let them go . ' mathieson was still sitting in his living room when police turned up . he got down on his knees and held out his hands when officers arrested him . mathieson , a car sales manager , carried out the horrific crimes at his home in falkirk , stirlingshire ( above ) , while his partner went on a work night out . he is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to murder and rape his partner , clueless as to what had happened in her absence , arrived back at the family property at about 2am . she was described as being ` hysterical ' upon learning what had happened . mathieson , a sales manager , was remanded in custody at the hearing today and will return to the dock next month . his court appearance was briefly interrupted today after he began crying hysterically and loudly retching as if he was going to be sick . in what is rarely seen in court , his qc donald findlay left his own seat to sit beside mathieson in the dock and speak to him briefly before the case continued . the court was given no reason for what caused him to carry out the horrific murder and rapes , but it is believed his drug problem may have been a factor . in the spring of last year , he had started attending cocaine anonymous having built up a large debt . his girlfriend was not aware of the drug habit until finding out about the cash he owed , the court heard . mr findlay , defending , said that before his crimes mathieson had been of ` impeccable character ' , but said he now accepted ` full responsibility ' for his actions . judge lord bannatyne deferred sentencing until may 7 . speaking after the hearing , detective inspector dave pinkney , from police scotland , said : ` the incidents that took place within the property in springfield drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults . ` police responded quickly to the area and detained mathieson almost immediately . ` following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences . ' i would like to thank the victims and the family of luciana maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation . ` while nothing can undo the pain steven mathieson 's actions have caused , they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence .

' i never liked savile , and i knew there was something about him that was odd but i did n't know what it was . ' i saw him very rarely but the way he was , you could never have a sensible conversation with him . ` but it was shocking when the stories came out . it 's tarnished that era , and it was n't really like that . most of us were just working hard , having a good time . ' his good friend and fellow dj , paul gambaccini , was also caught up in the scandal after spending a a year under a cloud of suspicion when he was arrested over historical sex offences . in his case the 65-year-old was accused of having sex with two underage boys , however , the crown prosecution service ( cps ) dropped the charges last year . blackburn said he is outraged at how gambaccini was treated and has called for lessons to be learnt . he said : ` if somebody has done something wrong they should be punished but i do think there is something appalling going on when someone , anyone , can accuse you of something . ` in paul 's case , he did n't know the people - and your name is just dragged through the mud . i saw him very recently and the fact is that there has been no apology , and he has lost a lot of money and it is not right . you have n't done anything wrong but it sticks . we need to learn something from this . ' blackburn has remained unequivocally untouched by scandal , and explained : ` that 's because i have n't done anything wrong , it 's as simple as that , ' he says emphatically . but the dj , who started his career on pirate station radio caroline in 1964 , has faced his own controversies after proclaiming he had bedded more than 500 women in his sixties heyday . blackburn said he never liked paedophile dj jimmy savile ( pictured ) , who sexually assaulted staff and patients aged between 5 and 75 over several decades rolf harris and dave lee travis were among blackburn 's former bbc colleagues caught up in the historic sex abuse scandal at the corporation he made the boasts in his 2007 autobiography poptastic ! my life in radio in which he said he had slept with 250 women -- a number which he then doubled five years later in a magazine interview . the father-of-two , who was born in surrey and brought up in bournemouth by his nurse mother and gp father , now admitted : ` it was tacky , it was unnecessary and i wish i had n't done it . ' it only happened , he maintains , as his autobiography 's ghost-writer said they needed a bit more sex , given the lack of drugs and ` rock n roll ' . blackburn says lessons need to be learned after his friend and colleague paul gambaccini ( pictured ) had charges against him dropped ' i was quite open about it - i do n't see anything wrong , and i never have , if two consenting adults make love that 's their business , providing it is all above board . ' i was n't that bad , i just had a really good time - but i wish i had n't written about it quite so honestly as it hurt my mum and dad . it really was n't clever . ' blackburn married robin 's nest actress tessa wyatt , mother of his advertising executive son simon , when he was 30 but she left him after four years when she discovered he had had an affair . he remarried in 1992 , this time time to debra , a theatrical agent 17 years his junior , and mother to his 18-year-old daughter victoria , and the family live together in hertfordshire . this time he has remained faithful and admits that when he discovered his calls had been intercepted during the phone hacking scandal , he was n't fazed . ` when all the phone hacking started i was called by the police who told me my phone had been hacked , ' he said . ` and i thought \" well , fine . that must have been boring . \" it did n't bother me as there was nothing to hide . so i never pursued it . ' three years ago he had to undergo laser eye surgery after he suffered a detached retina when he was mugged by three thugs who tried to steal his mobile phone as he left the bbc . ` it was like being descended on by a pack of wolves , ' he said . ` they knocked me to the ground , but i managed to get at them with my umbrella and i did chase after them even though i had blood pouring down the side of my face . ' i was on the phone to my wife at the time so she heard it all . it was pretty horrible . ' i did report it to the police , but what could they do ? my producer said \" they must have really hated your music \" . ' he has also recently started wearing a hearing aid to correct the creeping hearing loss after spending the last 50 years wearing headphones blasting music into his ears . ` you can barely see it , it fits snugly in your ear and there 's just this little clear wire . and they do n't whistle . wearing one just sharpens everything up a bit . they 're fantastic little things .

' torin lakeman , 19 ( left ) , and brother jacques , 20 ( right ) , died in a pub in manchester after consuming ecstasy they had bough from an anonymous dealer via the ` dark web ' the brothers were found dead in a room above this pub after going to watch manchester united play a game against hull at old trafford in december last year the brothers , both from the isle of man , were found in a hotel room above the grapes pub in bolton on 1st december last year after travelling to watch manchester united play at old trafford . the court was told that torin , a student of physics and planetary studies at aberystwyth university , had bought mdma from website agora from an anonymous seller with the ` handle ' stone island . torin 's housemate ethan bradley said he bought the drugs to ` have a good weekend ' , and that he would use the drug recreationally , but was not addicted to it . coroner alan walsh today said he was concerned at the ease with which the boys bought the lethal drugs , adding he would be writing to the home secretary jacques was living in chingford , london , at the time with his grandmother while training to be a chef , so travelled to meet torin in manchester , where the pair booked into the pub for the weekend . the hearing was told that both brothers had taken the drug on separate occasions . the pair watched as manchester united won their match against hull 3-0 , and father raymond lakeman said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together . he said : ` they were brothers so they had fallings out but on the whole they got on as best friends . ` they wanted to go and watch manchester united play hull city . i booked the tickets and sent them over with two football shirts for them . ` it was the first time they had ever done anything together like this . they did n't know anybody in manchester . they were looking forward to seeing each other . ` my wife and i were happier than we had been for weeks and months and years . ' landlord william pilkington later saw them in the bar and when asked whether they appeared to be drunk , he said they were ` on something else ' . detective inspector joanne clawson from greater manchester police said cctv from a local shop caught them buying two bottles of wkd and a packet of chewing gum which they took back to their hotel . the alcohol was never consumed . torin was the last to be seen when he came down from their room at around 9.30 pm to ask for the pub 's wifi password . both of the boys ' bodies were found on monday morning , when pub worker michael lawrence went to clean the room they had been staying in . bolton coroner 's court was told that jacques , along with his brother torin , had both consumed the drug before on separate occasions ( pictured , jacques alongside an unknown friend ) the court heard that torin ( pictured left , with a friend ) bought the drugs via website agora which can not be accessed through regular websites , before travelling to manchester to meet his brother mr lawrence told the inquest : ' i went into room five and saw one of the males on the floor in the room . at that stage i did n't see the other one . ` my colleague went into the room and found the body of the other male in this was on the far side of the bed that would have been hidden from view . ray lakeman , the boys ' father , said he was overjoyed that the boys were spending time together , and even bought shirts for the pair ' i was asked to check by police whether there was any evidence of tablets or drugs or anything untoward and i did n't see anything . ' a post mortem on jacques body found he had 6.15 mg of mdma per litre of blood in his body - almost six times the ` lethal ' amount of 1.7 mg . he also had 229mg of alcohol in his blood - almost three times the drink drive limit . his brother torin was found to have 7.08 mg of ecstasy in his body , while his blood alcohol levels were lower at 87mg . pathologist dr patrick ward told the inquest : ` if a person is not used it on a regular basis the impact may be greater . in batches of any drug there are different levels of toxicity . ` they could have taken the same amount but the concentration could have been different . i would anticipate they took the same amounts each . ' recording a narrative verdict , mr walsh said : ` they had a great day which makes the tragedy of these deaths even harder to accept . ` there was concern as to the quality and quantity of ecstasy in terms of concentration and that may well have been a factor in terms of the ultimate impact . ` they were likely to be tablet form but when they were taken and where taken is unknown . mdma is known as ecstasy and i accept there were sufficient quantities in the blood to cause death . ' he added : ' i accept the drugs were obtained by use of the internet and the drugs delivered to him from an unknown source by use of the internet on the dark web . ' i am concerned about the ability of young people to obtain elicit substances using the internet . ' i am well aware that is a global problem and little can be done to avoid this supply line being used . the death of jacques and torin identify a great problem - the dark web . recording a narrative verdict , mr walsh said the issue of the dark web concerned him ` as a father and a grandfather ' ( pictured , torin lakeman ) ` the dark web identified an anonymous supplier and the supplier exists behind the veil - a confidential and sophisticated veil . ` in the case of jacques and torin i hear reference to stone island and reference to agora . i believe these matter should be reported to the home secretary . ` young people have a natural ability these days with regard interned who find it much easier to access these dark sites and have available to them supply of drugs by simply ordering on the internet and delivering to address . ` as a father and grandfather it is a frightening prospect .

            "( cnn ) given that most people could n't tell the difference between a copyright and a trademark , it usually takes something controversial , such as the washington redskins ' refusal to change their name , to get people interested in trademark law . this week , a higher court scrutinized a lesser-known trademark -- when the band the slants sought to protect its name . the slants are five asian-american musicians from portland , oregon , who pay homage to the '80s on stage -- and homage to their heritage in an ironic way . \" we want to take on stereotypes that people have about us , like the slanted eyes , and own them , \" simon shiao tam , the band 's front-man , said . in other words , the group adopted the lenny bruce philosophy of repeating an insulting term until it does n't mean anything anymore . to the slants , \" slant \" is n't an insult , it is empowering . and more power to them . unfortunately , a bureaucrat at the u.s. patent and trademark office decided that \" slant \" was disparaging to asians , and denied them a trademark registration under the despised ( by me , anyhow ) section 2 ( a ) of the trademark act . this is the section that lets the government deny trademark protection to a mark that is \" immoral , \" \" scandalous \" or \" disparaging . \" in this case , the latter . this is n't billionaire dan snyder referring to other people as \" redskins . \" in l'affair redskins , it is the disparaged group , native americans , who are complaining -- not the government deciding on its own that it knows best . in the slants ' case , these are asian guys who say \" it does n't bother us , so why should it bother you ? \" and it is n't as if any asian american groups got involved . this is not the first time that someone has \" taken back \" a marginalizing term in a trademark fight . about 10 years ago , the motorcycle club \" dykes on bikes \" was similarly rebuffed , and they fought back and won the right to protect their mark . they made similar arguments that resonated : if they wanted to call themselves \" dykes on bikes , \" then what place does the government have in judging that decision ? in another decision , the trademark office initially denied a registration for buddha beachwear on the grounds that buddhists would find it disparaging . but on reconsideration , the trademark trial and appeal board held that it should go forward stating it is \" imperative that the board be careful to avoid interposing its own judgment for that of buddhists . \" so why are n't the slants given the same privileges as dykes on bikes or buddha beachwear ? it is largely a sign of the times . we find ourselves mired deeper and deeper in a society where people actually get excited to take offense at virtually anything . given the lingering controversy over the redskins ' trademark , our five friends from oregon did n't stand a chance . for starters , by trying to protect asians from racism , the court issued a disturbingly racist decision based on the fact that these were , in fact , asians who intended their band name to invoke their ethnicity . but , if a sicilian ( like me ) were to seek to register the same exact name , with no such intent , i would enjoy that privilege . this is n't quite korematsu v. united states ( the decision that authorized putting asians in internment camps ) , but the decision is quite unprincipled . even worse , this decision gets the first amendment wrong . the majority opinion almost flippantly discards the constitutional issues as much ado about nothing . essentially it says , \" we did it this way before , so we are going to keep doing it this way . \" your constitution got stepped on before , and who are we to take our feet off of it ? if you 're not upset by now , you should be . well , the court does give us a sort-of dissent styled as \" additional views . \" while not binding , some of our most cherished first amendment rights grew from the tiny seeds planted by the dissents of oliver wendell holmes . the dissent in this case recognizes the fact that trademarks are commercial speech , which is protected by the first amendment . it also notes that the government should not be in the business of giving out or withholding benefits on the basis of the content of the recipient 's speech . this is known as the doctrine of \" unconstitutional conditions . \" since section 2 ( a ) discriminates against first amendment protected expression on the basis of its content , the court has called for 2 ( a ) to be , finally , deemed unconstitutional . but , for some reason , it declined to actually go that far . it merely suggested it , without so ruling . and people wonder why my hair is falling out . i guess i will start a protest band and call them \" the guinea pigs . \" but , i wo n't be allowed to register that trademark -- although the five asian guys from the slants could . maybe we should just each register the other band 's marks , and trade them after we get past the bureaucrats at the trademark office . ruling a sign or our easily offended times\n",

            "a sales manager who claimed he was left too disabled to work after a ` minor ' road accident ten years ago has been accused of attempting a # 600,000 fraud - after being pictured out in a coffee shop with his celebrity friend max clifford . kevin morgan , 55 , of weybridge in surrey , was injured when a land rover discovery reversed into his stationary rover 75 while he was working in dorset in september 2005 . the married engineer suffered whiplash , which developed into chronic pain syndrome and a resulting deep depression , which together have ended his working life , his lawyers claim . but as his # 600,000 damages claim began at the central london county court , he was accused of a staggering fraud by motor insurers , direct line group . kevin morgan ( pictured right ) was filmed meeting up in a coffee shop with his friend max clifford ( pictured left ) . morgan claims that a car accident in 2005 has left him in too much pain to leave his home regularly william featherby qc , for direct line , said mr morgan had been put under surveillance and shown to be far from the disabled wreck he claims to be . he could be seen out walking , joking with a builder , striking up conversation with a stranger , crouching to fix the light on his car and as part of a gathering of friends -- including disgraced pr guru clifford -- in a coffee shop . ` we submit that the surveillance evidence shows no sign of disability or distress whatever ; rather , it just shows a normal man of mr morgan 's age , ' said the barrister . ` the court can properly find that he has been and is exaggerating deliberately to an unconscionable degree . ' the court heard mr morgan claims he is in so much pain , particularly in his neck , that he only rarely leaves his house . but the qc said he had been watched by private investigators on 12 random days over three years up to 2013 and seen leaving his house on 10 of those days . ` on the 10 days , you were out and about , walking briskly and behaving perfectly normally , ' he told mr morgan . ` when we see you on those 10 occasions , your neck does n't go into spasm . mr morgan is pictured outside central london county court where the fraud case hearing continues questioned on the difference in his demeanour on the day in the coffee shop and in court , mr morgan said one had been a ` good ' day and the other ` bad ' . ` i 'm not a dishonest person and i feel like it 's almost like i 'm on a murder charge , ' he told judge david mitchell . ' i feel like i need to clear my name . ' his barrister simon browne qc said the surveillance footage shown in court actually backed mr morgan 's case . ` it reinforces mr morgan 's post-accident limitations , as his daily life has been reduced to a 1,350 foot radius around his home , ' he said . ` the footage proves that he no longer participates in the maintenance and diy activities that were once such a large part of his life . ' the court heard that , before the accident and until 2009 , mr morgan had worked as a senior accounts manager for a tools manufacturer . he was a golfer and especially houseproud , keeping his home and garden in an ` immaculate ' condition , doing bricklaying , carpentry , plumbing and decorating himself . he and his partner of more than 30 years , deloris , holidayed often , visiting greece , germany , turkey and various destinations in the uk . the accident , and its after-effects , put an end to all that , mr browne told the judge . neck pain progressed to headaches , with blurred and double vision . his sleep was badly affected and he had numbness in his hands . a consultant psychiatrist who assessed him said his depression was most likely to have been caused by being told his chronic pain was ` likely to be incurable ' , he added . experts said he would probably never work again and was more likely to remain in a ` retired ' lifestyle , even at only 55 years old , he continued . if his claim was really fraudulent , he had managed to pull the wool over doctors ' and other specialists ' eyes for years , said the barrister . and , by taking such a claim to court , he was risking losing his home if it went against him , mr browne added . however , mr featherby said the accident was ` not serious ' and ` low impact ' , occurring when another driver reversed into mr morgan 's car as he sat stationary in a residential street . it displaced the bumper from his car , but he put it back on with the help of another and did not need to take any time off work immediately afterwards , said the qc . he said direct line accepted the accident was genuine and that mr morgan initially required attention for his injuries . however , the qc is focusing his specific allegation of ` fraud ' on the time after 2009 , when mr morgan was made redundant from his job . mr morgan strongly refutes direct line 's accusations .\n",

            "poland said it is demanding a formal apology from the u.s. over the comments made by fbi director james comey ( pictured above ) the us ambassador for poland has been forced to apologise for comments made by the head of the fbi who blamed polish people for helping the nazis kill jews during the holocaust . james coney had written an editorial opinion piece for the washington post claiming poland shares responsibility for the holocaust with germany . the piece sparked outrage among polish politicians and media . us ambassador stephen mull met with the polish deputy foreign affairs minister and apologised for the comments . he said : ' i made clear that the opinion that poland is in any way responsible for the holocaust is not the position of the united states . ` nazi germany alone bears responsibility . ' mr mull said he now had ' a lot of work ' to do to rectify the situation . comey 's april 16 opinion piece in the washington post stated that poland played a role in nazi germany 's genocide of six million european jews in the holocaust . ` in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil , ' comey wrote . the piece was titled why i require fbi agents to visit the holocaust museum . ` they convinced themselves it was the right thing to do , the thing they had to do , ' it continues . poland 's president bronislaw komorowski told public television that comey 's comments showed a ` lack of historical knowledge ' and were an ` insult to thousands of poles who helped jews ' . on sunday foreign ministry spokesman marcin wojciechowski wrote on twitter that mull would ` receive a note of protest and a summons for an apology . ' us ambassador stephen mull apologised to poland the us ambassador was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies in the polish capital on sunday marking the 72nd anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising . six million polish citizens were killed under nazi germany 's occupation of poland during world war ii . while half of the victims were jewish , the other half were christian . historical records show instances of poles turning against their jewish neighbours , either killing them or giving them up to the nazis . poles also risked their lives and families to save jews . in 2012 , us president barack obama caused outrage in warsaw when he labelled a world war ii nazi german facility in occupied poland used to process jews for extermination a ` polish death camp ' . he subsequently expressed ` regret ' at what he called his inadvertent use of the erroneous term ` polish death camp . ' poland 's government keenly watches the global media for descriptions of former nazi german death camps as ` polish . it says the term - even if used simply as a geographical indicator - can give the impression that poland bore responsibility for the holocaust . us ambassador to poland stephen mull ( pictured right ) was quick to present an informal apology at memorial ceremonies marking the 72nd anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising in warsaw on sunday ( above he lays flowers at monument to the ghetto heroes ) in the april 16 opinion piece titled why i require fbi agents to visit the holocaust museum , comey wrote : ` in their minds , the murderers and accomplices of germany , and poland , and hungary , and so many , many other places did n't do something evil ' ( above the united states holocaust memorial museum in d.c. )\n",

' the firm declined to say who the suit would be against , exactly , when asked by the washington post . however , the attorney has vowed to pursue ` all legal remedies ' to protect the rights of the maryland parents . the meitivs made headlines just before christmas when police found rafi and dvora walking the sidewalk on their own . picked up again : the meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by cps workers after their children -- who they raise with a so-called ` free-range ' approach -- were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone ` besides the policeman pulling up ... no ' : asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal sunday , 10-year-old rafi admitted he was , but not because he 'd been left alone with his sister free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called ` helicopter parenting ' . ` helicopter parents ' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring , micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe . however critics believe this creates under-confident , over-reliant children , while also causing the parents stress . free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach , where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own . instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe , the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time , and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves . on sunday , a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home . the children were picked up by police , who say they followed protocol by turning them over to cps . meanwhile , mrs meitiv tells fox 5 dc that cps workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe . what 's more , the elder child , rafi , insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police . ` they kept the kids for hours , ' a shaken danielle meitiv told fox 5 after being reunited with them . ` it 's 10:30 at night . they 've been missing since 6 o'clock ... somebody called 911 and the police called cps and they decided to bring the kids here and they did n't call us .

' when questioned , the meitivs say they believe in a so-called ` free-range ' approach to parenting , which encourages independence from infancy . in march , the cps found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone . it meant the agency would start a file on the family 's activities and whereabouts for at least five years . the meitivs hit back at the ruling , insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences . unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge , but is in most cases a prelude to such charges . it usually comes when the cps has deemed parents to have neglected their children , but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action . after sunday 's incident they were forced sign a paper pledging not to leave them unattended\n",

' wang has asked to represent himself in his trial and accused the public defender 's office of working against him while representing himself , wang will have an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses , call witnesses , make his own statements and testify on his own behalf . though wang did not testify at monday 's hearing , he referred to a rebuttal of the competency report in which he quoted dostoyevsky , socrates , richard nixon , abraham lincoln and alleged boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev , as well as recounts two parables . wang said that the experts misinterpreted his answers , misquoted him and lacked knowledge about his ` cultural background ' . one of the experts from the competency report , madelon baranoski , said that wang lost his ` path of rational thinking ' during the evaluation and that he suffers from ' a very serious mental illness ' . she added that his distrust of the public defender 's office was ` reaching psychotic proportions ' . ` it is our opinion that you need treatment , ' she said . police investigate the murder scene of yale university doctor vajinder toor in branford , connecticut , monday , april 26 , 2010\n",

' apparently it 's all about the ` secret stuff ' that chubbuck 's clients tell her . certainly it is well known that beyoncé 's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years . ' i told her to open up , to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her , ' chubbuck said . ` she started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional . she tapped into that well of pain inside her . ` she rang me up after we 'd worked together on the movie and said , ` listen to my new record -- it 's all the stuff you taught me . ' and that 's when she came out with single ladies and all the great female empowerment songs . the little pop star turned into a global icon .

' in other words , your guess is as good as mine . mendes continues : ` it helps you understand humanity -- what drives someone to do what they do , good or bad . it 's not painful ... it 's cathartic . ' chubbuck first met brad pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit , and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting . today , he is still a client and chubbuck worked on his most recent movie , fury . she made an icon out of brad pitt , who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit ` brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame , ' chubbuck said . ` he studied and worked . i would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because brad wanted to rehearse a scene three , four , five hours a day . he was dedicated to his craft . he had no social life . he had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me . ` for the major talents , fame is never the driving force . brad worked his butt off , he 's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder . he makes bold choices and is n't afraid to fail . ' so what is the secret ? chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your ` deepest , darkest past ' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen . some of this is outlined in a best-selling book the power of the actor ( gotham books ) which has been translated into 18 languages . stars such as kate bosworth , camilla belle , elisabeth shue and mendes have given the tome glowing reviews . mendes said : ` it is my bible -- i do n't leave home without it . ' chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to london and says the phenomenon of british actors dominating hollywood ( eddie redmayne , benedict cumberbatch , daniel craig ) is ` because brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves ' . do her celebrity friends such as matthew perry , james franco and jake gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment ? ` bottom line is they are with me to work , ' chubbuck says . ` celebrity goes out the window . i 'm about stripping them bare . the one thing i have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings . ` it does n't matter if you are in london or the philippines . there 's a shared human story -- we all want love , we all have issues with our spouses or partners , with our parents . the key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim . ` you have to use that stuff to empower yourself .

            "cleared : andrew anderson , 43 , pictured outside manchester magistrates ' court , was claimed to have forced a social worker to the floor , injuring her wrist a father-of-three has been cleared of assaulting a social worker following a black friday bundle at tesco over a 32in tv - after a judge said the chaotic scenes made it hard to blame anyone . andrew anderson , 43 , was accused of forcing social worker julie mcgoldrick to the floor , injuring her wrist , as they battled over the unit which had been reduced from # 199 to # 99 as part of the frenzied midnight sales event . the self-employed gardener ` strategised ' his shopping and grabbed a tv near the bottom of a pallet in manchester , only for mrs mcgoldrick , 53 , to grab the same one at the same time - and suffer injuries that saw her end up in hospital . however , a judge at manchester magistrates ' court has now cleared him of any wrongdoing , saying it was not certain that mr anderson ` went on not caring whether she was hurt or not ' . the court was told how mrs mcgoldrick slipped her hand behind the tv box 's security cable in an effort to hang on because she could not hold it normally due to her injured thumbs . but seconds later she ended up on the floor and in serious pain as tesco workers grabbed mr anderson and pulled him while he was holding the tv - taking the trapped woman with them . cctv footage was shown at court where a judge called the incident ` extraordinary ' and said ` excitement and tension ' had built up before the reduced blaupunkt tvs were unveiled . the video showed dozens of shoppers piling into tesco to get their hands on discounted goods as part of the annual us tradition of black friday , which has received a controversial reception since being brought to britain in 2008 . arriving at the store just ten minutes before the 12am opening time on november 28 last year , mr anderson , of middleton , manchester , managed to get to the front of the queuing throng - beating some shoppers who had waited for up to four hours . black plastic sheets covering a pallet of cheap tvs were still in place at 12.15 am at the store in burnage , manchester , which led to shoppers becoming ` frustrated ' and ` upset ' , the court heard . fracas : mr anderson ( wearing the grey hat , circled ) ` strategised ' his shopping and grabbed a tv near the bottom of a pallet , only for julie mcgoldrick ( in the light blue jacket ) to grab the same one at the same time when the sheets were eventually lifted , cameras captured the ` free-for-all ' , with customers pushing and shoving to get the best chance of grabbing their discounted sets . mrs mcgoldrick had attended the tesco with her 30-year-old daughter marie to try to grab a bargain tv for her , while mr anderson had arrived with his mother , girlfriend and young child . after the incident , police were called and arrested mr anderson , while mrs mcgoldrick was taken to hospital where it was feared she had broken her wrist . she was released the next day with bruising . cctv footage of the moment mrs mcgoldrick fell to the floor was played repeatedly in court as it was argued tesco employees can be seen pulling mr anderson which ultimately lead to her injury . mrs mcgoldrick described the five minutes before midnight as ` chaotic ' . she said : ` i put my hands out and around a box . i do n't have use of my two thumbs . ` so i put my hand through the wire and grabbed it with my forefingers . i was holding the box and then people were coming forward to get other boxes around me . video : cctv footage of the moment mrs mcgoldrick ( in light blue jacket ) fell to the floor was played as it was argued tesco employees can be seen pulling mr anderson ( in grey hat ) which ultimately lead to her injury ` the box was grabbed quite violently and i fell back . then as i looked up i saw the same gentleman who is here today . he could have had the tv but i could n't let go because my arm was in the wiring . ` i was saying \" let go , i ca n't let go of the tv , can you please let go ? \" i was trying to pull the cord to release my arm . once my arm was released i felt sick and shaken . ` somebody had gone to get frozen peas but an ambulance had already been called . ' mr anderson told the court that he had gone to another nearby tesco earlier in the evening but had moved on because it looked like they only had coffee machines on the pallet . he added : ` i had to strategise . i thought they would all go for the tvs at the top so i went for the bottom and picked the tv . ' he faced a day-long trial but was cleared of common assault . after the hearing mr anderson said : ` i knew it was going to be a tussle . i 'm not sure why a middle-aged woman was there anyway . in attendance : mrs mcgoldrick had attended the tesco store in burnage , manchester , with her daughter marie to try to grab a bargain tv for her , while mr anderson had arrived with his mother , girlfriend and young child ` when you go to something like that you know what you are in for . i 'm sorry the lady 's hand got caught . there was nothing i could do . everyone wanted to get a tv . timed to follow thanksgiving , black friday was an all-american tradition marking the beginning of the christmas shopping rush . us stores have made the day a huge event , promising big short-term discounts to create excitement and queues outside shops . but it has been marred in recent years by aggression among shoppers . in 2013 , an 11-year-old girl was taken to hospital after being trampled by a crowd in new boston , ohio . in 2008 , a walmart worker died after being crushed by frenzied customers at a long island store . it is thought black friday , first brought to the uk seven years ago by online retailer amazon , was so named as it is the day stores go ` into the black ' financially . last november police chiefs appealed for calm after sales-crazed shoppers sparked a wave of disorder and violence . bargain hunters were accused of behaving like animals as they grappled over coffee machines , hair-dryers and computers . ` there was no-one going out to injure people . i do n't know why she put her hand in the security tag . i did n't even get my tv in the end . i even missed out on the sainsbury 's sale at 6am because the police held me until the afternoon . ` everyone was there looking for a bargain and that 's all it was . i thought i would get a tv quickly without people realising and she has seen me come up with a tv and thought \" i will have that one \" . there was nothing i could do . i 'm just a bargain hunter . ' he added : ` after that i did n't even go to the january sales . i 'm going to stop going to sales . i would rather pay full price because it 's not worth it if this is what ends up happening . ' clearing mr anderson of wrongdoing , district judge anthony carr said : ` mrs mcgoldrick tried to get one or two tvs disappearing before her eyes , and did get her hand on a box - and unfortunately got her hand through the wires , because she thought that was the best way to hold on to it . ` mr anderson is taken to one side and mrs mcgoldrick is taken to one side with him because she is attached to the box . i have to be satisfied that he went on not caring whether she was hurt or not - and i ca n't be . ' no tesco staff directly involved in the melee were called to give evidence . after black friday last year , police were called to eight tesco stores in greater manchester and three men were arrested . at the time , greater manchester police 's chief constable sir peter fahy said the incidents were ` totally predictable ' , and criticised supermarkets over their security arrangements .\n",

' but he denies a single instance of killing or cruelty - even though he witnessed plenty . such a defence worked in germany before 2011 and the trial of sobibor death camp guard john demjanjuk , but no longer . demjanjuk was tried and convicted for being part of the machinery of mass murder at the camp where 250,000 jews were liquidated without a single shred of evidence linking him to a crime . there was no-one left alive to testify at his trial in munich for his role in the extermination of 28,000 dutch jews . no-one could say whether he slaughtered with his bare hands , but he was convicted , for the first time in history , simply because he was there - and that is why groening now has his appointment with justice . groening , who lives near the lueneburg heath - ironically the place where his boss , ss chief heinrich himmler , was buried in an unmarked grave after committing suicide when he fell into british hands at the end of the war - lived a comfortable life after the war . he married , had two children and worked as a wages accountant in a glass factory after being released from a pow camp in britain . groening was in auschwitz as a guard for two and-a-half years , but prosecutors are charging him with complicity in the murders of 300,000 people over a two-month period in 1944 he spoke at trials after the war of the operations of the gas chambers and crematoria but denied any involvement . now a frail widower , he bears little resemblance to the young soldier with thin glasses shown in a black and white wartime photograph , except for the shadow of a military tattoo on his left arm bearing his ` o ' blood type . groening has said he volunteered for the waffen ss in 1941 at age 20 , drawn by wartime fervour and ` the elegance of the uniform ' . but he testified to his nightmares in interviews before he was charged . ` every night and every day i remember it for the nightmare it was , ' he said . ` it was in 1942 that my ss chiefs in berlin ordered me there . ' i was an official in the prisoners ' possessions administration which basically involved removing the money , jewels and other valuables from the inmates , registering it and sending it back to berlin . ` they had diamonds and gold worth millions and it was my duty to make sure all of it got to berlin . ` it was completely understood by all that the majority were going straight to the gas chamber , although some believed they were only going to be showered before going to work . many jews knew they were going to die . ` one time a drunken ss man discovered a crying baby on the platform . he grabbed the waif by its legs and smashed its head against the side of a truck . my blood froze when i saw it . ` when i saw this i went to my superior officers and made an application for a transfer to the front , to anywhere . down the years i have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment . i will never be free of them . ` it was becoming harder and harder to suppress everything i saw . on one night in january 1943 i saw for the first time how the jews were actually gassed . it was in a half-built farmyard near to the auschwitz-birkenau camp . a gas chamber was built there . we were searching the wood nearby for prisoners who had escaped . loved ones ( pictured being interviewed before the trial ) have travelled thousands of miles to bear witness as co-plaintiffs against groening between may 16 and july 11 , 1944 he was on duty when 450,000 hungarian jews were transported there , with 300,000 being gassed just after arrival . ` there were more than 100 prisoners and soon there were panic-filled cries as they were herded into the chamber and the door was shut . ` then a sergeant with a gas mask went to a hole in the wall and from a tin shook zyklon b gas pellets inside . in that moment the cries of the people inside rose to a crescendo , a choir of madness . these cries i have ringing in my ears to this day . ' i again made an application for a transfer and at the end of october 1944 i was shipped to the belgian ardennes where i served with a fighting unit until capture . ` but you can imagine that down the years i have heard the cries of the dead in my dreams and in every waking moment . i will never be free of them . ' i have never been back there because of my shame . this guilt will never leave me . i can only plead for forgiveness and pray for atonement . ' kurt schrimm , who heads germany 's sole nazi hunting agency , prepared the case against groening . three more are pending against former auschwitz personnel but age and infirmity seem likely to derail those proceedings before they begin . judith kalman , 61 , also from toronto , has travelled to represent her sister evike , who was six when she was gassed upon arrival at auschwitz during one of those days that groening was on duty . she said : ` she never grew up . she will be a six-year-old child forever . a talented , cute little girl who taught herself to read . ` there is not only a shadow on my family , there is a shadow on my whole life . she was gassed 75 days after her sixth birthday on june 3 1944 . what could have become of this talented , gifted child ? ' i do n't feel resentement or hatred when i think of groening . i believe him when he says he never laid a hand on a jew . he is unsure himself of his guilt . he wants to have peace of mind , to justify himself , but he knows there can be no justification . ' i will be there for evika and for all the others who were murdered . he chose to participate in this crime and participated with conviction . and now , finally , he must answer for it . '\n",

' another part claims chaplin delayed marrying lita after she fell pregnant in an attempt to get her to have an abortion or ` criminal operation ' . and the silent movie star was accused of calling his young bride a ` gold digger ' who tried to ruin his career and stood in the way if his professional success . the papers also contain an order stopping chaplin from moving his wealth before the settlement so it would not affect the court proceedings . only around 16 copies of the divorce proceedings were believed to have been made , one sent to chaplin himself and the others sent to various film companies and banks , involved in the proceedings . the papers for sale in devon , were sent to the 1st national bank of los angeles on the 11th jan 1927 . almost a century later they are being sold by parade antiques on plymouth for # 15,000 . the papers for sale were sent to the 1st national bank of los angeles on the 11th jan 1927 lita claimed that she endured ` cruel and inhumane ' treatment by chaplin in the legal papers john cabello , who owns the antiques shop , said : ` we got it from a person in america - he was told to clear out some supplies and old documents at the bank and he found them . ` he was told they would be thrown away and he kept them instead . ` when the papers were published , chaplin was ostracised for a while . people in the know thought he was quite a nasty piece of work . ` all this comes out and makes for quite hard reading , even by today 's standards . ' rob morrish , 27 , who runs the shop 's website , poured over the historic legal documents . the 27-year-old said : ` about a week 's worth of work went into researching the document , reading through it took some time . ` it 's all hand signed and very old and fragile . it was folded for a long time and required a lot of very careful handling .

' the united states has backed the saudi-led campaign , which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on yemen 's main southern city of aden after seizing the capital sanaa . president abedrabbo mansour hadi fled aden for saudi arabia during the houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces . riyadh has accused tehran , the major shiite power , of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-iran state on its doorstep . but iranian foreign minister mohammed javad zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting , which has cost more than 640 lives since march 19 , according to the world health organization . military force : saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the saudi-yemeni border , in southwestern saudi arabia patrol : saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with yemen mr kerry , fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with iran on its nuclear programme , said washington was not looking for confrontation with tehran . ` but we 're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that iran might be making . ' in another sign of growing us support for the saudi effort , the pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition . the first refuelling flight took place on tuesday night with a us air force kc-135 stratotanker providing fuel for a f-15 fighter jet operated by saudi arabia and an f-16 flown by the united arab emirates , spokesman colonel steven warren said . iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has warned that last week 's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . and president hassan rouhani said separately that the islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless ` all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day ' . ` what has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement , nor its contents , nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end , ' said khamenei , who has the final word on all matters of state . after a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations , tehran and the six powers agreed on april 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of june reining in iran 's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions . ` everything is in the detail , it may be that the other side , which is unfair , wants to limit our country in the details , ' khamenei said , in his first comments on the deal . iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has warned that last week 's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of iranian cities - khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as ` there is nothing to take a stance on ' . ` officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding . i am neither for nor against .

' i have always supported and still support the iranian negotiating team , ' khamenei said . ' i welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation , but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged . ' iranian president hassan rouhani said the islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless ` all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day ' he said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for iran 's future development . ` the nuclear industry is a necessity , for energy production , for desalination , and in the fields of medicine , agriculture and other sectors , ' he said . in a potential obstacle to any final deal , rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement . ` we will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day , ' he said . the pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord . western governments , which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the united nations , have been pushing for it to happen only gradually . ` in return for iran 's future cooperation , we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted iran 's economy , ' us secretary of state john kerry said last week . rouhani , who was speaking on iran 's national nuclear technology day , reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme . ` we will have a tanker sortie every day , ' warren said , adding that all flights will be outside of yemeni air space . the air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in aden overnight thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city , a source in pro-government forces told afp . air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern shabwa province that was seized by the houthis ' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman ali abdullah saleh , a local official said . the official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to saleh , who has been accused of joining with the houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an arab spring-inspired uprising . yemen has been wracked by conflict since saleh 's ouster , with hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions . supporters of the shiite houthi militia brandish their weapons in the yemeni capital sanaa . washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country conflict : yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of aden yesterday as well as the houthis , who hail from yemen 's north , the government has struggled against al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network 's branches . authorities in yemen had for years allowed washington to carry out a drone war against aqap but us forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest . al-qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the houthis . as the fighting and air campaign drag on , concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis . some aid trickled in to aden by ship on wednesday but efforts by the international committee of the red cross to organise flights of cargo planes into sanaa have so far failed . in aden , witnesses have said the situation is dire , with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help . smoke and flames rise from shiite houthi rebel camps following an airstrike by the saudi-led allianceearlier this week a yemeni child receives treatment at the burns unit of a hospital in sanaa , following a reported airstrike by the saudi-led coalition earlier this month diplomatic efforts have stepped up to resolve the conflict , with the iranian and pakistani foreign ministers pledging to work to find a negotiated solution . zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks , calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance , dialogue among yemenis and the formation of an ` all-inclusive government ' . turkish president recep tayyip erdogan was also quoted on thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting . ` the groups in yemen should meet and work on possible solution . saudi arabia , turkey and iran should be involved in efforts for a diplomatic solution , ' erdogan was quoted as saying by turkish media .\n",

            "it 's not every day two senior barristers in the nation 's highest court go head to head over the fate of a pooch on death row . but on tuesday in canberra that 's exactly what happened . condemned staffordshire terrier izzy is set to be destroyed after she bit a woman in august 2012 after escaping from her owner tania isbester 's backyard in the basin , east melbourne , victoria . lawyers for victorian woman tania isbester appealed to the high court hoping to have her staffordshire terrier , deemed aggressive by knox city council , saved from being put down . the woman who izzy bit suffered a 1.5 cm to her finger on august 4 in 2012 , which is deemed as a ` serious injury ' under the domestic animal act in victorian law , and izzy was seized by the council in june 2013 . this is the first time a dog on death row is having its case heard in australia 's highest court . condemned staffordshire terrier izzy is set to be destroyed but could be saved by a final high court bid richard kendall qc , representing ms isbester , argued a member of the panel which determined izzy 's fate had a conflict of interest . kirsten hughes investigated the attack izzy made in august 2012 and presented evidence at a later magistrates court hearing in which ms isbester pleaded guilty . ms hughes then informed her about a panel hearing to determine the dog 's fate , before participating in it and helping to draw up the final reasons , mr kendall said . ` ms hughes had a fundamental part in the process of decision making , ' he told the court , claiming she was both the accuser and acting as judge . justice patrick keane took exception to that characterisation criticising the lawyer for ` sliding into personal attacks ' . ` well , i 'll desist , ' mr kendall conceded . lawyers for the council argued there was no judge in the case , but rather an administrator making an administrative decision . stephen donaghue qc acknowledged ms hughes played a role on the panel , but said the final decision was made by another member . ms isbester had three staffordshire terriers , including izzy , which were involved in attacks on other dogs after escaping from her backyard in the basin , a suburb in melbourne 's east . in 2013 she pleaded guilty to a charge relating to an 1.5 cm cut allegedly caused by izzy on the middle finger of a woman trying to pull the dog away from her daughters . a dog on death row will for the first time in history have its case heard in the high court of australia the dog has been housed by the rspca since it was seized two years ago , sparking a lengthy legal battle . lawyers representing the dog at no cost to the client say the local council that is fighting for izzy 's destruction in the high court is wasting public money by perusing the case . city of knox council has refused rspca south australia 's offer to rehabilitate the pet and assume all liability for her at no extra cost from the time of collection . ` the council is prepared to spend a six figure sum fighting to kill a dog when they might lose in the high court , ' barrister graeme mcewen , founder of the barristers animal welfare panel told daily mail australia . ` no dog should be allowed to be killed by a council expect by court order , ' mr mcewen argued . in normal circumstances izzy 's case would never have made it to the high court but her fate has taken an unusual twist due to the manner in which the local council made in administrative decision for her to be put down . in a letter to the city of knox council , the ceo of rspca sa tim vasudeva , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome izzy at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed . the letter , seen by daily mail australia and written on september 9 , 2014 , said : ` as discussed late last week , i can confirm that rspca south australia would be happy to transport the dog known as izzy ( owned by tania isbester ) to our lonsdale animal shelter here in adelaide in order for her to undergo an extensive behavioural assessment under the guidance of our qualified behaviourists . ' ` this would involve a wide variety of behavioural interactions and analysis both inside and outside kennels , in our indoor behavioural centre and our outdoor fenced enclosures . the purpose of this would be to determine , in as thorough a manner as possible , the rehabilitation prospects of this dog . ` we are able to arrange collection and transport at no expense to knox city council . rspca south australia are prepared to take izzy into our care and custody and assume all liability for this dog from the time of collection . ' in september 2013 , izzy 's owner ms isbester pleaded guilty to charges of her dog causing ` serious injury ' at ringwood magistrates court but the local council , the city of knox , did not apply for a destruction order on izzy from the magistrate at that time . if they had applied for the order from the magistrate , the question of whether the penalty ( death ) was proportionate to the injury caused ( a 1.5 centimetre cut ) would have been raised on appeal to a judge at the county court . instead , the council ruled that the dog should be destroyed during a council panel meeting . during the panel hearing , which took place on 30 september , 2013 , at knox civil centre , one of the people on the panel was the same council officer who brought the charges against izzy 's owner ms isbester . the team of barristers fighting izzy 's case from the barristers animal welfare panel , including richard kendall qc and andrew felkel , is now challenging the decision that the panel came to based on administrative law grounds . ` the council officer who brought the charges then sat as a member of the three person panel which decided to put the dog down , ' mr mcewen told daily mail australia . ` the question of law is whether a fair minded observer might think that the accuser sitting on a panel is a ) a conflict of interest or b ) with a disposition of pre judgement . ' izzy has been living in a cage at the rspca centre in victoria for more than 21 months while the legal battle has played out . victoria 's highest court first upheld the decision to destroy her on september 10 , 2014 , but the barristers have now been granted special leave permission to appeal to the high court of australia . mr mcewen admitted : ` it 's a bit of a story . ' ` only one in ten cases get through on special leave application . ' in a letter to the city of knox council , the ceo of rspca sa tim vasudeva , wrote an offer to assess and then possibly rehabilitate and rehome her at no cost to the council instead of seeing her destroyed . but the council knocked back the offer . ` rather than accept the offer and bring the matter to an end - avoiding legal proceedings at cost and removing her from their municipal boundaries of city of knox - and not leaving a family heartbroken ... the city of knox refuses and now they have got to fight in the high court , ' mr mcewen said .\n",

            "it seems like an idyllic smattering , with nothing more to worry about than sun , sea , sand and where the next cocktail is coming from . but one organisation is asking tourists to investigate before heading to the exclusive holiday destination to ensure they are not visiting a resort associated with human rights abuses . known for pristine beaches and crystal clear water , the maldives has recently come under scrutiny after the country 's former president , mohammad nasheed , was found guilty of terrorism charges earlier this year . ethical maldives alliance is encouraging tourists to boycott ` high risk ' resorts linked to human rights abuses now , the ethical maldives alliance is encouraging tourists to consider the instability in the region when booking their accommodation . the alliance has crafted a list of over 100 well-known hotels and is urging visitors to consult the guide before travelling . although very little detail is provided when it comes to the alliance 's rationale for dubbing certain resorts to be ` high risk , ' it has colour-coded the hotels into three categories . those to be avoided are labelled red , those coded as green are considered to be ` low risk ' and orange hued businesses are ` under consideration . ' ` while okay to visit in the short term , there is a possibility that they will be on the ` to avoid ' list in the longer term , ' the website reads . ` therefore , early reservations for visits later in the year should be avoided . ' the group claims that the ` red ' or ` orange ' resorts are directly or indirectly linked to human rights abuses . hotels are coded as ` low risk , ' ` high risk , or ` under consideration ' depending on their ties to corruption by boycotting , the alliance hopes that tourists will help to make a difference in protecting and promoting democracy , while not adversely effecting the maldivian economy . ` with a long and sad history of corruption , political oppression and human rights abuses , maldives ' first attempts at democratic reform are now faltering , ' a statement on the alliance 's website reads . crime is reportedly on the rise as a result of support for ` extreme gangs , ' which are supported by police to suppress any dissent . ` uncontrolled corruption starting at the very top of all branches of government filters down through all levels of society , making life very difficult for the average maldivian . ' though most resorts are categorised as ` low risk , ' conrad maldives rangali island is listed as one to avoid while most resorts are categorised as ` low risk , ' several top name hotels have been included on the alliance 's list of those to avoid . among them , the conrad maldives rangali island . ` ethical maldives evaluates resorts and other businesses on ethics-based criteria , ' the website reads . ` these include owners ' support for governments that perpetuate corruption , intimidation and oppression , measures relevant to the environment and social responsibility . ' in response to allegations presented by the ethical maldives association , the high commission of the maldives told mailonline travel : ` resorts appear to be categorised not on the basis of any practices in their resorts , but on the basis of alleged links of their owners to the government of the maldives . ` with only two resort groups targeted and very little information about the identities of those behind ` the ethical maldives alliance , ' it is difficult to discern the true intentions and objectives of the website . ` over the past months , the maldives ' young democratic institutions have proven themselves in challenging circumstances , while the government of the maldives has maintained a positive , engagement-first approach with international stakeholders . ` the government of the maldives will always remain committed to promoting development , human rights and the ethical values that we all hold dear . ' mailonline has reached out to both the ethical maldives alliance and a spokesperson for the conrad maldives rangali island resort for comment .\n",

            "a federal judge has ordered the internal revenue service to hand over a list of the 298 tea party organizations that it targeted with broad and often intrusive questions when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status . the decision from u.s. district judge susan dlott means right-wing groups are a step closer to being allowed to pursue a class-action lawsuit against the irs . the agency has admitted playing political favorites with the tax code beginning in 2010 , when it began applying extra scrutiny to groups with red-flag words like ` patriots ' or ` tea party ' in their names . while those organizations ' applications were held up for years , liberal groups sailed through the process . federal tax-exempt status is confered on groups that serve a public purpose , including issue advocacy , and allows them to promise tax deductions to their donors . f.u.i.r.s. : american conservatives were up in marks in 2013 after the irs confirmed it had been slow-walking tax-exemption applications from tea party groups based on red-flag words in their names lois lerner , the former irs official at the heart of the tea party targeting scandal , ran the ` exempt organizations ' division until late 2013 when she retired with full benefits ; the justice department said this week that it wo n't prosecute her for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions tax-exempt organizations are not permitted to work for or against candidates for public office , but they can use up to half of their funds to make public arguments about political matters like tax policy , the obamacare insurance overhaul , the environment or foreign policy . dlott agreed this week that the tea party groups suing the government can pursue their claims that the irs violated their first and fifth amendment rights , along with a section of federal law -- section 6103 of title 26 -- that prohibits the government from releasing private information contained in tax returns . when the treasury department 's office of inspector general investigated the irs 's actions , it demanded -- and received -- a list of 298 groups whose tax-exemption applications had been held up . it 's this list that the tea party groups want . their lawsuit aims first to identify a list of ` all dissenting groups targeted for additional scrutiny by the irs from january 20 , 2009 , through july 15 , 2013 . ' dlott could then choose to certify that list as a ` class ' of plaintiffs . irs commissioner john koskinen has insisted that his agency is no longer targeting conservative groups with special scrutiny , and has offered to green-list any group that promises it will limit its political activity to 40 per cent of its budget -- but some organizations are holdout out , claiming the law entitles them to a 50 per cent limit the irs 's lawyers claimed that they could n't provide the court with the names of all the groups , saying they would have to turn over the very documents that section 6103 requires them to keep confidential . the conservative plaintiffs said they would be happy to have only the spreadsheet that the inspector general got from the irs . dlott agreed and ordered the agency to hand it over . ` the court concludes that the return information sought is directly related to the issue of class certification in this federal court proceeding , ' her ruling reads . ` the names of the putative class member organizations and their control dates -- the date which the putative class member organizations submitted their applications for tax exempt status to the irs -- are directly related to the issue of class certification . ' dlott decided that without the list , the plaintiffs would n't be able to show all the disaffected conservative applicants it has already identified share common experiences at the hands of america 's tax collectors . courthouse news service first reported her ruling . the irs is the federal agency americans most love to hate , polling worse in opinion surveys than congress a partial list was unearthed by usa today in september 2013 , showing that as of 2011 the irs had questioned the political advocacy of 162 right-wing organizations and delayed approving their tax exemptions . in an irs spreadsheet published online by the newspaper , partisan government officials characterized the activities of 21 of those groups as ` propaganda . ' dlott also ordered the irs to tell the court whether or not that list was authentic , the washington times reported . former irs official lois lerner , who has been at the center of the targeting scandal since it emerged in 23 months ago , was facing the possibility of criminal contempt of congress charges until the obama administration 's department of justice declined on monday to prosecute her . lerner , under subpoena in may 2013 , delivered an opening statement professing her innocence during a hearing but then refused to answer questions .\n",

' during that time she was bedbound for 18 months in hospital , but decided one day she was better and started getting involved as an actress and planning to go to america to finish her studies , the inquest heard . when she was 18 she had her appendix removed without telling her parents . in may 2014 , after going under anaesthetic for an ` unnecessary operation ' she began to hear voices . she also suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder ( ocd ) and spent three to four hours a day washing herself and her possessions , leaving her skin raw and bleeding . at one point she was admitted to hospital after her body mass index dropped to 15 , the inquest heard . the inquest heard that miss hadley , pictured , suffered from psychosis but hid the condition from doctors , making them think she was not a suicide risk she was treated at the priory clinic for ocd , but was released because she refused food and doctors feared she would starve herself to death unless she was allowed to return home and be treated there . her father explained : ` we sought expert psychiatric help for her which she rejected . ` she became increasingly psychotic , the voices returned with intensity . it was unintelligible to her that her illnesses were not physical . we hope she is finally at peace and her soul is in a better place .

            "across the globe , more than 42 million children under the age of five are overweight or obese . and the rising tide of obesity extends into adulthood with 1.9 billion adults worldwide overweight , 600 million of which are classified as obese . but with experts desperately trying to find the answer , a poignant debate rages . should fast food and sugary drink companies be allowed to advertise their junk food to children ? should tv ads promoting unhealthy food and drink be banned until the watershed , or wiped out altogether to save adults ' waistlines too ? a recent survey by the british heart foundation showed two fifths of parents are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on tv , prompting the charity to deliver a 30,000 strong petition asking the government to ban junk food adverts being shown before the 9pm watershed a recent british heart foundation survey quizzed more than 2,000 parents with children under the age of 16 . it showed two fifths of them are badgered by their children each week to buy food after seeing it advertised on tv , and feel that tv junk food adverts make it difficult to help their children eat a healthy diet . if you are a parent like me , you are probably nodding knowingly about now . there is plenty of scientific evidence to back up our frustrations too -- showing that food commercials aimed at children focus on products high in fat , salt and sugar , and that youngsters develop positive attitudes towards the foods they see advertised . despite regulation , children in the uk are still being exposed to more tv advertising for unhealthy than healthy food items , even at peak children 's viewing times . what 's more , regulation does n't prevent the advertising of unhealthy products during programmes in the ` family entertainment ' bracket , which include some of the most popular television programmes watched by children such as x-factor and britain 's got talent . seven in ten parents said they would like stricter regulation on the food industry 's use of advertising . the bhf has therefore just delivered a 30,000 strong petition , asking government to ban junk food adverts from being shown before the 9pm watershed , to help protect our children from making unhealthy choices . do you think the big food and drink manufacturers are unduly worried about this ? not when they can use one of our national icons to act as a giant advertising hoarding instead . dr sally norton criticised coca-cola 's sponsorship of the london eye , noting it gives the company the chance to advertise to almost four million visitors a year as someone at the forefront of managing obesity , i am furious that we are allowing blatant advertising to influence our children in other ways . take coca-cola 's sponsorship of the london eye . with london eye staff apparently wearing coca-cola branded uniforms to match the promotional material displayed around this family attraction , the company gets the chance to advertise to 3.75 million direct visitors a year . what 's more , we will do plenty of advertising for them as we promote the ` coca-cola ' london eye , our top paid-for tourist attraction , around the world . as coca-cola knows all too well , linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the london eye is likely to forever link coca-cola to the idea of ` fun ' in the minds of young , impressionable kids ( and adults ) . dr norton backs the british heart foundation 's bid to ban tv junk food ads before 9pm merlin entertainments , who own the london eye , said customers were able to make their own minds up about what to include in their diets . true -- but the stark truth is that we are n't making the best choices , with two thirds of us overweight , a quarter of us obese and the nhs spending # 6 billion pounds a year on obesity . that same ` failure of personal responsibility ' meant the government recognised that we needed extra help to tackle smoking -- and widespread advertising bans and preventing smoking inside public buildings was implemented . in just the same way , we ca n't tackle obesity alone and need help -- not giant coca-cola branded wheels reminding us of the sugar-laden temptations it promotes . reducing tv advertising to children as the british heart foundation are suggesting , will , of course reduce the number of junk food advertisements children see . but , as the london eye disgrace shows , junk food advertising is n't limited to tv . there are plenty of ways by which companies can market to kids or adults outside of tv advertising and the regulations for non-broadcast advertising are currently weak or non-existent . our children seem to spend an increasing amount of time online , actively engaging in social media , and the junk food and drink manufacturers are busy providing games , social networking apps and other tools to promote their brands in cyberspace where the adults often fear to tread . a study by the children 's food campaign , of 100 websites featuring food likely to be bought or requested by children , found that more than 80 per cent of online adverts were associated with foods classed as less healthy and therefore not allowed to be advertised during children 's tv programmes . yet more than 75 per cent featured child-friendly characters , competitions , downloads and links to social media apps that directly engaged with kids . this is because the internet regulations do n't prevent our kids being targeted and manipulated in this way . this 21st century method of targeting our teens is a sneaky way of tapping into a ` screen-obsessed ' generation . she says : ` as coca-cola knows all too well , linking its product to happy and exciting events such as visiting the london eye is likely to forever link coca-cola to the idea of ` fun ' in the minds of impressionable kids ' sponsorship , whether of tourist attractions or sporting events like the olympics , is another great way of ensuring that products trigger positive connections -- harnessing the feel-good factor , which can last well into the future . interestingly , research has also shown that companies seen to be involved in ` charitable ' activities or corporate social responsibility can lead consumers to infer that their products are healthier and even lower in calories , leading them to consume more . their good deeds create a ` health halo ' effect , just in the same way labelling and packaging can persuade consumers that they are buying a healthy , ` natural ' products for themselves or their children . sneaky junk food advertising is invading all aspects of life -- how can we resist ? so , it 's a big ` yes please ' to banning junk food advertising before 9pm . but do n't think for a minute that this will deter manufacturers of the high sugar , high fat , processed food that provides little , if any , nutritional benefit for our kids . plenty of other advertising opportunities are open and they are busy working on how to manipulate us and our kids into buying more and more of the heavily processed rubbish that is damaging our health .\n",

' morsi is facing two other trials in which he could face the death penalty , including one that sees him accused of spying for foreign powers . verdicts in those two cases are due on may 16 . sisi has vowed to ` eradicate ' the brotherhood , an 85-year-old movement that topped successive polls between mubarak 's fall and morsi 's presidential election victory in may 2012 . supporters and opponents of the muslim brotherhood clashed during 2012 street battles in the mediterranean coastal city of alexandria the authorities designated it a ` terrorist group ' in december 2013 , making even verbal expressions of support punishable by stiff jail terms . the crackdown sparked a fierce backlash including from jihadist groups , who have claimed a string of deadly attacks on security forces . officials say more than 500 police and soldiers have been killed in attacks since morsi was overthrown . sisi was elected president in may last year , but he faced no serious challengers and - in a country where the army has been in power for decades - his victory dashed hopes raised by mubarak 's ouster of a civilian democracy . sisi 's regime is popular among many egyptians tired of political turmoil and seeking stability and economic growth . but sisi has been accused of repression and his crackdown has also targeted secular and liberal activists who spearheaded the 2011 uprising against mubarak . in november , a court dropped murder charges against mubarak in his own trial over the deaths of hundreds of protesters in 2011 .\n",

            "pope francis has angered the turkish government by describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5 million armenians in 1915 as ` the first genocide of the 20th century ' . the pontiff made the comments at a 100th anniversary mass on sunday , prompting turkey to summon the holy see 's ambassador in turkey told the vatican ambassador it was ` deeply sorry and disappointed ' in pope francis , adding that his comments had caused a ` problem of trust ' . turkey said pope francis has caused a ` problem of trust ' after describing the mass-murders of up to 1.5 million armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 as ` the first genocide of the 20th century ' while turkey accepts that many armenians died in clashes with ottoman soldiers beginning in 1915 , when armenia was part of the empire ruled from istanbul , it denies that the victims reached the estimated 1.5 million and that this amounted to genocide . today was the first time a pope has publicly used ` genocide ' to describe the massacre , although it is a term used by many european and south american governments . in 2001 , pope john paul ii and armenian apostolic church supreme patriarch kerekin ii called it ` the first genocide of the 20th century ' in a joint written statement . francis , who has disregarded many aspects of protocol since becoming pope two years ago , uttered the phrase during a private meeting at the vatican with an armenian delegation in 2013 , prompting a strong protest from ankara . as the archbishop of buenos aires before becoming the leader of the world 's 1.2 billion catholics , jorge maria bergoglio had already publicly characterised the mass killings as genocide . pope francis listens as the patriarch of the armenian catholic church nerses bedros xix tarmouni speaks during a mass on the 100th anniversary of the armenian mass killings in st. peter 's basilica at the vatican mass : pope francis greets the head of armenia 's orthodox church karekin ii , during an armenian-rite mass on the occasion of the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the armenian genocide in memoriam : prelates take pictures as pope francis during the mass in the vatican today in november , the argentine-born pontiff made an official visit to turkey as part of his efforts to solidify relations this april marks the 100th anniversary of the massacre of an estimated 1.5 million armenians by ottoman turks . the anniversary of the mass killings in world war one will be commemorated by armenia on april 24 . the killings in 1915 are regarded by many historians as the first genocide of the 20th century , and are said to have inspired nazi leader adolf hitler . armenians say up to 1.5 million of their kin were killed between 1915 and 1917 as the ottoman empire was falling apart and have long sought to win international recognition of the massacres as genocide . turkey rejects the claims , arguing that 300,000 to 500,000 armenians and as many turks died in civil strife when armenians rose up against their ottoman rulers and sided with invading russian troops . several european countries recognize the massacres as such , though italy and the united states , for example , have avoided using the term officially given the importance they place on turkey as an ally . last year , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan issued a message of condolences to descendants of armenians killed and said turkey was ready to confront the history of the killings . more recently , erdogan has accused armenians of not looking for the truth but seeking to score points against turkey , saying numerous calls from turkey for joint research to document precisely what happened had gone unanswered . at the start of the armenian rite mass in st. peter 's basilica , pope francis described the ` senseless slaughter ' of 100 years ago as ` the first genocide of the 20th century ' , which was followed by ` nazism and stalinism ' . ` it is necessary , and indeed a duty , to honour their memory , for whenever memory fades , it means that evil allows wounds to concealing or denying evil is like allowing a wound to keep bleeding without bandaging it ! ' francis 's comments were also published by armenian president serzh sargyan 's office on sunday . ` we are deeply grateful to his holiness pope francis for the idea of this unprecedented liturgy ... which symbolizes our solidarity with the people of the christian world , ' sargyan said in a speech at a vatican dinner on saturday evening . after francis 's remarks on sunday , turkey swiftly summoned the vatican 's ambassador in ankara to protest and seek an ` the pope 's statement which is far from historic and legal truths is unacceptable . religious positions are not places where unfounded claims are made and hatred is stirred , ' foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu tweeted . the foreign ministry in ankara later issued a statement conveying its ` great disappointment and sadness . ' it said the pope 's words signaled a loss in trust , contradicted the pope 's message of peace and was discriminatory because francis only mentioned the pain of christians , not muslims or other religious groups . francis also urged reconciliation between turkey and armenia , and between armenia and azerbaijan over the disputed caucasus mountain region of nagorno-karabakh . a letter handed out during a meeting after the mass to sargyan and the three most important armenian church patriarchs present .\n",

' ` troubles with different folk ' is a polite way of summing up his career . boldly , neil lennon took a gamble on signing him for # 900,000 in january 2014 . griffiths had accumulated yet more front-page cuttings from while on loan at hibernian from wolverhampton wanderers following a racism row on social media . the doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to leith -- where else ? -- to attend an edinburgh derby as a hibs fan . he was in a pub where offensive chants about hearts and former tynecastle attacker rudi skacel were filmed and posted on the internet . in october , he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football . when the legal action is concluded one way or the other the sfa will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute . griffiths was wolves leading goalscorer in january of last year , scoring 13 goals in all that attracted interest from celtic though , with the scottish striker penning a four-year deal with the bhoys the potential for embarrassment to celtic is apparent and , perhaps for that reason , lennon 's successor , ronny deila , appeared to make a judgement the player was n't worth the hassle . he was no one 's definition of a deila 24-hour athlete . yet the norwegian 's attitudes to griffiths began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for celtic 's development team against sunderland of his own accord . within days he was back in the first team , scoring in a 2-1 defeat to dundee united at tannadice . in the five months since , he has usurped john guidetti in the starting xi and is now regarded as deila 's most potent attacker . ` he looks as if he has matured as a player , ' adds chisholm , now a scout with sunderland . ` he never wanted to be an out-and-out striker when i had him at dundee . he always drifted out into wide areas . ` he still does that , but i think he has improved . his hold-up play and movement is better . ` he is playing with good quality players , getting better service and i am hopeful he has turned a corner now .

' they go onto state : ` should henthorn truly be able to substantiate an inability to afford counsel in the criminal matter , those matters are properly addressed in the criminal case pending in this district . ' they point out : ` the colorado supreme court has said : \" killers can not receive life insurance proceeds from their victims \" and insurers can not disburse proceeds \" prematurely \" , ... . when law enforcement is still investigating or a prosecution is pending . ' the next named beneficiary is his nine-year-old daughter with dr bertolet , hayley . dr bertolet died on 29 september , 2012 . the autopsy report , dated 18 december 2012 , stated that she ` died as the result of multiple blunt force injuries when she fell or was pushed down a cliff while hiking . ' it concluded , ` homicide can not be excluded . ' but when her husband submitted a claim for the life insurance death benefit policy almost exactly a year later , on september 27 , 2013 he gave her cause of death as ` accidental fall . ' at the time henthorn was unaware that he was already the subject of an fbi investigation that lasted two years and scrutinized every aspect of the widower 's life , culminating in his arrest last november . but despite facing murder charges henthorn has not relinquished the claim his claim to the substantial insurance pay out on his wife 's death . shockingly , not only is he fighting for the pay out to fund his own defense , documents filed in a separate motion in march show that he fought his late wife 's family to have funds from dr bertolet 's estate released into his possession . last february the district court of douglas county , colorado found in dr bertolet 's family 's favor and barred henthorn from accessing his late wife 's estate on the grounds that allowing him to do so posed an ` imminent risk of substantial harm . to [ its ] financial interests . ' both ` freak accidents ' occurred at remote locations with henthorn the lone witness . both occurred after about 12 years of marriage and henthorn , pictured here with his first wife , rishell , told wildly varying stories about both deaths . henthorn and lynn rishell when he was a new geology graduate from virginia . the couple moved to colorado , where after 12 years of marriage , she died in a ` freak accident ' , now said to be murder henthorn ( left ) , pictured with grace ( center ) and lynn ( right ) rishell , was named as the sole beneficiary in a string of lucrative life insurance policies totaling $ 500,000 on the death of his first wife and $ 4.5 million on the death of his second after they both died in what appeared to be freak accident henthorn attempted to overturn this decision as recently as december and only finally failed when a court denied him access to the funds and demanded that he appoint a forensic accountant to detail the contents of his late wife 's estate . in march daily mail online revealed that , in 2009 henthorn took out a life insurance policy on his former sister-in-law , grace rishell . grace was going through a divorce and ` concerned for her financial stability , ' when she initially agreed to henthorn 's suggestion that she take out a policy that would pay $ 50,000 to grace 's brother and each of her four daughters for a total of $ 250,000 . according to prosecutors in dr bertolet 's murder case , ` the evidence will show that henthorn had a romantic interest in rishell . ' but she had a change of heart in spring 2010 and told the insurance agent to stop the policy from going through . instead she took out a policy of her own with another insurer . yet unbeknownst to her , ` her signature was forged to procure the original policy as well , ' with henthorn making payments on the policy until december 2012 and listing himself as the sole beneficiary . the policy was cancelled in 2013 when the insurer concluded that henthorn had no insurable interest in rishell . but the very fact of its existence raises the specter that henthorn had rishell in his sights as a third potential victim . henthorn was denied bail by us district attorney judge kathleen latoyfa who described him as a ` danger ' and said , ` there are rather glaring similarities between the loss of his first wife and the loss of his second .

' i do n't say that the nursing home is bad but to me the belief i have is that you take a person to a home if that person has no-one to look after her but as far as beryl is concerned , i am ready to look after her until god finalises .

' similarly to the first lawsuit , the new complaint alleges that the school district was aware of brianne altice 's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her . she allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on bail for charges relating to the first two students . her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars . not happy : altice is pictured in court in february after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied the student who brought the initial lawsuit in march accused the district of being negligent when it hired altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him . he claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex . he stated that the school district had reprimanded altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired , the tribune reported . school district spokesman chris williams said at the time he was unaware of the lawsuit . despite the claims against her , one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against altice are ` ridiculous ' and ` she does n't deserve to be here ' . in trouble : altice , pictured at a hearing in february 2014 , allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 he told the court he had sex with altice once prior to october 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in december , while she was out on bail . in august 2014 , a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former davis high english teacher , whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal . altice 's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students . ` it is her defense that they did not happen at all , ' he wrote in a motion . ` that she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students . ' but prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions . the teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of altice 's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body . one of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the english teacher , left , even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students . she was first taken into custody in 2013 brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial , arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in october 2013 to interview her . brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children , call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her . ` her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called miranda rights , ' brass wrote in court papers . ` the evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement . ' in february , she requested to drop one of the charges , claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys . but a judge denied the motion . altice would be tried separately in each student 's case -- meaning she 'll get three different trials .\n",

            "( cnn ) the best part of the supreme court oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice ruth bader ginsburg alluded to s&m . ok , she did n't actually mention s&m , but ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was \" a dominant and a subordinate relationship . \" \" yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , \" said ginsburg . \" it was her obligation to follow him . \" mary bonauto , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the supreme court , said in response : \" that 's correct . ... for centuries we had and europe had this coverture system where a woman 's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles . and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated . \" once upon a time , wives were the legal property of their husbands and \" marital rape \" was not only not a crime but not even a concept . to argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully naïve . justice anthony kennedy , widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines , at one point referred to \" the nobility and the sacredness of marriage . \" which is true , if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present . if anything , the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people . one downside to arguing that marriage has \" always been \" between a man and a woman is that , therefore , any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples , too . the one justice who did n't ask a question is clarence thomas , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench . it should be carefully noted here that thomas is a black man married to a white woman . anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in maryland . that means that by 1967 , when the supreme court considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the american \" definition \" of marriage for over 300 years . just 20 years after the supreme court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , clarence thomas and his wife , virginia , were married . james braxton peterson , director of africana studies at lehigh university , has written , \" the fact that the thomas ' marriage required progressive supreme court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment . \" clarence thomas did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the supreme court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own . but perhaps the example of clarence thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of america , the supreme court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics . perhaps this was always the case , justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales . still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law . on the one hand , pulling pages right from republican presidential candidates , conservative chief justice john roberts suggested the court should n't intervene in a state-driven social debate . aping conservative religious activists , justice samuel alito asked whether four people could then get married . on the other hand , justice stephen breyer talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while justice elena kagan pushed back on whether legalizing same-sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite-sex couples . both arguments , and the moral force beneath them , seemed to echo gay rights messaging . still , the highly political and momentous decision in loving vs. virginia was unanimous . whichever way the court rules on same-sex marriage , it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous . so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the supreme court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved . blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up america in general , the supreme court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics . the question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision -- i think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment . the question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other .\n",

            "they 're the ultimate status symbol for the ultra-rich , but superyacht owners or charter clients are n't content to just sip margaritas in the sun or watch films in their on-board cinemas . they spare no expense or detail when they throw extravagant parties and they go to great lengths to one-up fellow members of the world 's one per cent or impress their celebrity guests . money is no object to those who like to flaunt their massive wealth at sea , and that means sales and charter brokerages are kept busy with outrageous requests for everything from high-end food and entertainment to luxurious decor and special guests . superyachts can sell for more than # 50million , while others cost more than # 400,000 a week to charter henry smith , a sales broker with cecil wright , a boutique yacht brokerage with offices in monaco and london , said : ` you do get some pretty unusual requests . the strange ones are demanding , particularly when food has to be sent from one place to another at the last minute . ` when you 're doing requests like this you 're paying considerably more than if you were to organise it in advance . but then again , as people say , this is yachting . ' in a fast-pace world where brokers expect the unexpected , these are some of the most outrageous requests from superyacht owners and charter clients . one superyacht owner threw a party with two live tigers , allowing guests to pose for photos with the animals a life of pi situation was avoided when an owner from europe threw a party with two live siberian tigers on board . under the care of trained professionals , the tigers were held in glass cages on the aft deck , allowing partygoers to pose for selfies with the animals in the background . mr smith said the biggest challenges were sorting out the insurance and paperwork , and lifting the tigers onto the superyacht . hoisting caged tigers onto a yacht is n't covered by the normal premiums . mr smith said : ` getting them physically onto the yacht was an issue because they had to lift them using cranes . ` the people who owned the tigers were wary to allow other people to operate the machinery , and it took several weeks of paperwork once we found a specialist insurer . ' mr smith said the tigers were rented from a circus and were taken off the yacht after the party ended . he said : ` it went off without a hitch in the end , but it was an awful lot of work on our end . but that 's what we do , that 's what we 're paid for . ' cecil wright arranged for fresh fruit and vegetables to be flown from the french riviera to the maldives special delivery -- from france to the maldives it 's the comforts of home that people miss the most when they travel for long periods , but that is n't a problem for the world 's super-rich . one client had a week 's worth of fruit and vegetables sent from their favourite shop in the south of france straight to their superyacht in the maldives . of course , the container had a travel experience that most people will never have -- it was flown from france to the island nation in the indian ocean by private jet . once it arrived in the maldives it was loaded into a helicopter and delivered to the superyacht , where it landed on one of its decks . mr smith said there was ` nothing fancy ' about the food , which arrived undamaged and fresh . the owner just wanted a familiar taste from back home . he said : ` the value of the food on the flight was significant less than the value of the flight . ' three ` a-list ' musical acts were hired to perform at a private party that took four months to plan one client wanted to have a huge party on a deserted island for 80 friends and family members , so a team of engineers had to be flown out to set up a stage and other amenities . the private party featured performances by three ` a-list ' musical acts from the uk and us ( mr smith was n't at liberty to reveal their identities ) , who were flown in by private jet and helicopter . mr smith said it took four months of planning and three weeks to build the venue . this included flying in generators to power the sound and lighting systems , a professional grade kitchen and living accommodation for the construction crew . some owners have built classrooms on board and hired teachers for around-the-world voyages sailing around the world in a floating classroom superyacht owners do n't let their children 's education get in the way of their ambitious plans for an around-the-world family holiday . they bring the classroom -- and the teacher -- with them . mr smith said some owners have had small classrooms built within their superyachts so their children can keep up with their studies . they have also hired teachers to deliver lessons while travelling to some of the most exotic places on earth . for the teachers , it is an incredible way to see the world while getting paid and not having to pay for a home or utility bills . mr smith said : ` [ salary ] varies enormously on things such as age and the amount of holiday they get , but you 'd be looking at certainly a minimum of # 50,000 . ' baking an eight-tier cake is a very complex and time-consuming process , and a boulangerie in the south of france had just 24 hours to prepare one after a ` last-minute ' request . the cake , decorated with edible flowers , was prepared in a hurry for a guest 's birthday party in saint-tropez in the french riviera . mr smith said : ` they were working flat-out to make this thing , and it required a lot of convincing on our part to convince them to do it . ` this eight-tier monster cake looked like a bouquet almost , with lots of very intricately designed and hand-cut edible flowers . it was impressive to say the least . ' one crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons for a girl 's birthday party ` a sea of pink and silver ' sticking with the birthday theme , cecil wright once received a request to organise a surprise birthday party for an owner 's granddaughter . the crew had just two hours to blow up 2,500 pink and silver balloons , using compressed air tanks , as it was the only time the youngster was off the vessel . mr smith said : ` they finished just in time . it was a huge panic and a rush , and they had to bring in a few guys to help from other yachts . it was just a sea of pink and silver . ' two owners exchanged a steinway grand piano , but it had to be dismantled and transported across europe the world 's toughest piano move ? when one owner ( let 's call him mr x ) purchased a $ 70million ( # 50million ) superyacht it had a steinway grand piano on board . but he was not a fan , so he gifted the beautiful piano to his friend ( who we 'll call mr y ) . the only problem was that mr x 's yacht was in spain and mr y 's was in germany . instead of waiting until the yachts were in the same port , a team from steinway was brought in to dismantle the piano , package it and transport it across europe to mr y 's yacht , where they put it together . the cost of dismantling and moving the piano was nearly the same as purchasing a new one . cecil wright arranged the installation of a squash court on a helipad that lowers with the press of a button cecil wright was responsible for installing the world 's first squash court on a superyacht . the full-size court was set up on a helipad that can be lowered with the press of a button when it 's not in use . it is a permanent fixture on the ship , and doubles as a helicopter hangar . one couple hated travelling with luggage so much that they do n't bother anymore , and they get a new wardrobe delivered every time they embark on a new voyage . mr smith said : ` whenever they arrive all their clothes from the previous time are removed and new clothes are added . ' in addition to the latest fashions , the couple travels with an entourage that includes a hair stylist , nail technician , a doctor and maid .\n",

spreading himself wide and blocking the welshman 's strike with his right arm - after barely more than three minutes had elapsed was hugely important . it was beautiful , crucial . the amazing atmosphere generated by atletico 's supporters would have been dented by a goal that early . oblak makes a superb save to deny james rodriguez ( third left ) from opening the scoring for real madrid better was still to come , oblak making a superb save from a james rodriguez snap shot , which he did n't see until very late , the highlight of a first-half in which he made six stops . it was altogether reminiscent of the backbone atletico relied on last season , with goalkeeper thibaut courtois essential in their la liga triumph and road to the champions league final . and all this after sitting on the bench for half the season . another fruitless evening for gareth bale nobody can say that gareth bale did n't work hard enough for real madrid here , but instead that he just was n't good enough . the world 's most expensive player endured another frustrating evening , which started in the worst way possible when he missed a one-on-one chance . played in down the right , bale had the ball on his favoured left foot , but his finish was too imprecise and oblak made a brilliant save . bale did n't get involved much in the first half , with the game passing him by as sometimes it tends to do . bale ( left ) worked hard again for madrid but failed to have the desired impact as atletico kept him quiet bale ( right ) sees a shot saved by atletico keeper oblak as he endured another frustrating night he upped the effort in the second period but to little effect . working back in the right-back position he tried to skin guilherme siqueira , but the atletico man nudged him and bale tumbled . in attack he nearly eked out an opportunity for cristiano ronaldo towards the end , but the portugal striker was instantly closed down . it was that kind of night for real madrid , and yet another one for gareth bale . mad mario does n't play for liverpool ... he 's at atletico atletico madrid are good at replacing their strikers , after they are perennially taken by bigger teams . fernando torres was replaced by sergio aguero , who was replaced by radamel falcao , who was replaced by diego costa , who has now been replaced by mario mandzukic . while the croatian has n't quite lived up to the chelsea striker 's standards in terms of crucial goals , he 's as ready for a fight as the spaniard , and that 's saying something . mandzukic , like costa , also gets short shrift from the referee , with his reputation going before him . he riled dani carvajal up so much here that the real madrid defender snapped and punched him in the chest . the theatrics that followed were part of his skill set of dark arts too , even if referee milorad mazic was n't buying . mario mandzukic was left bloodied after a stray elbow from sergio ramos but got little sympathy from the ref ramos and mandzukic clash , leaving the altetico madrid striker needing treatment for a head injury a stray elbow from sergio ramos left mandzukic with blood sprayed across his face , but he knows what the deal is at atletico -- the pleasure comes with the pain . eventually it was the striker who ended up , somewhat harshly , in the serb 's notebook for fighting too hard in an aerial duel . although he could n't find the net himself , his hold-up play was essential in giving atletico some breathing room and it 's for the best that a row with diego simeone seems to have been buried . history says it 's advantage atletico this season real madrid have taken on atletico seven times and not won once . this was the third draw ; diego simeone 's side have won the other four games . the argentine coach will be pleased with this result , because now a goalscoring draw at the santiago bernabeu next wednesday will see his team through . so far this season madrid have scored four times against atletico , while the rojiblancos have netted 12 in reply , including five at the bernabeu . antoine griezmann ( left ) will be crucial to atletico madrid 's chances of winning in the santiago bernabeu madrid will be obliged to attack and that will suit atletico just fine . simeone 's side are built to resist and with antoine griezmann up front , they will be able to hit los blancos on the counter . last season chelsea came to the vicente calderon and fought for a 0-0 draw . they took that back to stamford bridge and were soundly beaten by atletico madrid , 3-1 at home . simeone will feel quietly confident his men can repeat the trick once more . furthermore , like for the 4-0 humbling madrid suffered in february , marcelo is suspended and fabio coentrao , who has been out of favour , will play . mario suarez was booked against madrid and suspended too , but tiago mendes can slot in for him without much fuss .\n",

            "a barrister and oxford university graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted , a court heard . peter barnett , 43 , is said to have caused a loss of # 23,000 to chiltern railways over a two-and-a-half year period . he travelled from his oxfordshire home to london marylebone but pretended to have only gone from wembley , in north west london . peter barnett , 43 , is said to have caused a loss of # 23,000 to chiltern railways over two-and-a-half years barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between april 2012 and november last year the australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to # 9,714.40 in fares , claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket , and take into account annual leave . but prosecutor malachy pakenham told westminster magistrates ' court : ` if it is accepted that the loss was # 23,000 , this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the united kingdom . ` the crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it . ` the train company are experts , not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed , you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket , you calculate it on a full single fare , of the return for the day , each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket ' . barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between april 2012 and november last year . barnett claimed to have travelled from wembley , in north west london , instead of thame , oxfordshire the scam began to unravel for barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at marylebone last november . the rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from wembley , instead of thame , oxfordshire , where he and his wife live in a # 550,000 five-bedroom detached home . barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor . when he turned his back barnett ran away , but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day . an investigation was carried out by british transport police , which found the lawyer had dodged fares since april 2012 . the lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law , despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an african children 's charity and director of leading think-tank , the legatum institute foundation , aimed at ` promoting prosperity ' . a court heard how the barrister got off at london marylebone ( pictured ) by tapping out with an oyster card it is understood he did so by boarding a train at haddenham and thame parkway without a ticket , and then getting off at marylebone by simply tapping out with an oyster card . because there was no start point to his journey , the automated system charged him the maximum transport for london fare , which is currently # 7.60 . but this is still far less than the # 19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home . the case was adjourned until july 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to chiltern railways . barnett was released on unconditional bail . the deception places him among the ranks of britain 's biggest fare dodgers , closely behind a former millionaire fund manager . jonathan burrows was banned from working in the city last year after avoiding # 43,000 in train fares from his home in stonegate , east sussex . burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets , accrued over five years , within three days of being caught .\n",

' nationwide protests of police actions that resulted in deaths of african americans in ferguson , new york and cleveland laid bare racial tensions and what president barack obama called ` simmering distrust ' between police and communities . black offenders are also less likely to have their cases dismissed by a municipal judge and they are more likely to be taken into custody on outstanding warrants during traffic stops , compared to their white counterparts . the justice department plans to use the findings to negotiate policy changes with ferguson officials and enter a consent decree , or to sue the city to force change . previous federal investigations into police departments have resulted in such changes as reporting arrest data to the justice department and installing federal monitors to oversee operations . the report 's findings vindicate critics who have cited a pattern of abuse in ferguson . but they are unlikely to restore full trust in the ferguson police by citizens who were angered when a grand jury decided not to indict michael brown 's killer , officer darren wilson . after a separate investigation , the justice department decided not to pursue federal charges against darren wilson , who has said he acted in self-defense . ` what it shows is that a culture existed and was allowed to fester in ferguson municipal government and ferguson police department . what we have seen so far is a few voluntary resignations but not a full acceptance of responsibility for that culture that has been allowed to exist in that municipal government , ' st. louis official antonio french said of the emails . ` even after the doj report ... there is still a lot of work to be done and it still remains to be seen whether the people who remain in power will be the ones to make the change .

            "travelling can be tiring , especially if there are many flights involved and jet lag . however for one sleepy explorer , a trip of a lifetime to witness the amazon rainforest seemed to be all too much - that or he was completely uninterested in the adventurous trips he was booked on . redditor roxambops , aka roxy de la rosa posted the pictures of dozing alex elenes on the social networking site this week with the caption : ` went to the amazon , cousin slept everywhere . ' the traveller went on a trip of a lifetime to see the amazon rainforest ... but he missed the whole thing being asleep ! even a trip piranha fishing could not stir the slumberer from his nap incredible nature moments the traveller missed due to napping include a pink dolphin watching tour and even a nail-biting piranha fishing expedition . sadly he even missed seeing adorable sloths and monkeys in the wild , and impressive giant amazon lily pads . when action was required of him , and he was due to take an intrepid jungle hike , naturally he slept through his alarm and missed the whole thing . the pictures were captured by his cousin roxy de la rosa who posted them on reddit cousin roxy said that her slumbering companion had been the one to push for the trip and that he chose the trip over going to machu picchu since he was set on seeing the jungle . the bemused san diego said : ` he had no real reason to keep falling asleep ; he also slept any time we we were in our room . ` our trip was to iquitos , peru , for a few days at the end of february , and cost around # 1,000 ( $ 1,600 ) just for the amazon addition . ' the sleeper had pushed for the trip , and said he was keen to see the amazon rainforest in particular as he had already been to machu picchu , the alternative trip alex is said to be bemused at his new found internet fame , following the pictures going viral on the site . roxy said : ` he 's surprised anyone else thinks it 's funny besides us . ` my favourite thing is that his biggest fear is falling out of a moving car while sleeping , yet he was fine napping on a tiny boat in the giant amazon river . ' the trip cost alex upwards of # 1,000 ( $ 1,600 ) and he even missed getting up for the jungle trek completely\n",

' i learned cpr at school and i started doing chest compressions and mouth to mouth . ` he started breathing again but it was more snorting than breathing . ` i 'm in shock and it still has n't hit me that this actually happened . it feels like it is n't real . ' miss wilson revealed how bradley had grown up in the house opposite her and they went to primary school together . ` he 's a really nice lad and i 've never heard a bad word said about him . i did n't know he was being bullied . i do n't think he told anyone .

            "when a young mum posted images of her post-pregnancy body on instagram to inspire others , she might have anticipated a raft of supportive comments for her bravery . hannah moore , 20 , from broxburn in west lothian , did n't get that far though ; her images of the stretchmarks on her tummy were vetoed by the world 's biggest photo-sharing website within minutes of her posting them . the mum-of-twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate ` nudity and violence ' which breach the site 's decency guidelines . confidence shattered : hannah moore , who had shots of her stretchmarked stomach removed ` within two minutes ' of posting them on photo-sharing site instagram , said the rebuttal had taken her confidence away body pride : hannah moore , 20 , of broxburn in west lothian , shared photos of her post-childbirth body . she gave birth to twin girls lily and grace ( pictured above with fiance david johnstone , 22 ) in june last year hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls lily and grace with fiance david johnstone , 22 , in june last year . moore said : ` nobody could get on my instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away . ' it 's yet another example of instagram coming under fire for refusing to publish certain images , particularly photos that are dedicated to showing the female form in its most honest state . shots of menstrual blood , stretchmarks following childbirth , pubic hair and naked breasts have all felt the wrath of the site 's censors . critics have also highlighted that plenty of images that many might find offensive such as users bragging about extreme wealth while poking fun at the poor or pro-guns graffiti often get the green light for publication . just last week , instagram , which boasts 300 million monthly users , announced that it has toughened up its rules on the types of pictures users can post in a bid to cut down on pornography and harassment . samm newman received an apology from instagram for removing these images of her in her underwear . the 19-year-old had posted the shot to celebrate her curves ... but later found they had been removed megan tonje saw a picture of her bottom - covered by sizeable black pants - banned for contravening instagram 's rules , even though she posted it in a spirit of body confidence with the hashtags #honormycurves and #effyourbeautystandards the overhaul of instagram 's community guidelines is the biggest since facebook bought the app three years ago for $ 1 billion . although it has banned ` close-ups of fully nude buttocks ' , it remains perfectly fine to post a shot of a woman 's rear if she is wearing underwear . a spokesman for the site said : ` we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do n't allow nudity on instagram . one rule for one : images such as the shot above , taken from the picture stream of american social media star dan bilzerian , appear liberally on the site star support : willow smith joined the campaign to use images of bare breasts by tweeting this picture on her @officialwillow twitter page last year the #freethenipple campaign saw a host of web users staging their protests against what they perceived as sexism by instagram ` this includes photos , videos , and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks . ` it also includes some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed . ` nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too . ' however , the boundaries laid out above seem to contradict the image posted by many . when singer-songwriter meghan tonje published an image of her bottom in underwear in may 2014 , she was dismayed to find it promptly removed for being deemed as ` mature ' content . tonje says you do n't need to wander very far on instagram to find images of photos of other women in a similar pose , which have all been published by the site , leading to accusations that she was discriminated against because she was bigger than some of the bikini models who feature . elsewhere , earlier this year , an australian media agency sticks and stones claimed the site had removed one of its images which showed two women wearing bikinis and showing some pubic hair . sticks and stones said the photo-sharing site had ` censored ' their image and argued that it was a sexist move and it would not have happened had the shot been a picture of two men . ainsley hutchence , the agency 's director , said at the time : ` unfortunately instagram has ruled out natural hair that appears on all bodies of women that do n't trim their bikini lines . ` this hair occasionally does spill out of the sides of swimwear as it does on men in their underwear . but instagram seem to be ok with man pubes . ' he added : ` clearly this is absolutely sexist . instagram believes that women should wax or get off their platform . ' this shot , published by australian media agency sticks and stones , was banned by instagram for showing public hair . the agency said it though the image would have been published if it had shown two men when photographer rupi kaur published a photo of a woman lying fully clothed on a bed with menstrual blood between her legs , the site removed it twice , saying that kaur was n't following ` community guidelines ' . other high profile bans include a protest by scout willis ( daughter of bruce willis and demi moore ) who saw a photo of a jumper with two bare-breasted women on it removed from the site . willis said at the time : ` women are regularly kicked off instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed . ` while photos sans nipple -- degrading as they might be -- remain unchallenged . ' such ` unchallenged ' images might include the profile of us poker player dan bilzerian , who regularly posts near pornographic images of women alongside misogynistic language . his posts include a woman dressed in provocative school uniform-type dress but with her shirt tied beneath her breasts and only pink tape covering her nipples . in other shots , scantily clad women cavort together or thrust their cleavage into the camera . after pressure from critics , the world 's most popular photo-sharing website has been forced to clarify how it treats certain images . last week , instagram said it was making clearer what exactly is allowed . ` we know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature , but for a variety of reasons , we do n't allow nudity on instagram . fans were not happy when michael buble shared this instagram photo from his miami holiday accompanying it with hashtags that included the words ' #myhumps #babygotback #hungryshorts ' despite stipulating that close-ups of ` fully nude buttocks ' are banned on the service , kendall jenner posted a side-on view of her posterior without complaints ` this includes photos , videos , and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse , genitals , and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks . ` it also includes some photos of female nipples , but photos of post-mastectomy scarring and women actively breastfeeding are allowed . ` nudity in photos of paintings and sculptures is ok , too . ' its censoring filter may have received attention but as our images show , there are plenty of photos that might cause offense that have made it through : when global music star michael bublé posed in front of a female in miami last week to deliberately highlight her bottom , the image was promptly published to his million-strong following on instagram . the photo , which the singer tagged with the words ' #myhumps #babygotback #hungryshorts #onlyinmiami ' , shows a close shot of bublé in the foreground while the rear of a female shopper was clearly in view . in spite of a public apology and wide criticism , the image remains on bublé 's site . such ` unchallenged ' images might include the photostream of us poker player dan bilzerian , who regularly posts images of scantily clad women . many instagram users will be baffled as to why an image depicting a woman who is practically topless , as her shirt is tied beneath her bust , has been allowed to stay on the site . bar two bits of tape on her nipples , the woman 's breasts are entirely bare , yet it falls within the rules , essentially on a technicality thanks to the strategically placed tape . kendall jenner , meanwhile , posted a provocative that depicts the side of her entirely naked bottom , with a car balanced on the top of one cheek , yet despite the stipulation regarding ` close ups of fully-nude buttocks ' , the shot has been deemed acceptable . instagram says it does n't allow nudity on the site , yet enables shots such as the above to appear on the page of us poker player dan bilzerian only words , say instagram ... this image promoting the use of guns was published by user andygotphotos a young user came under fire for describing her father as her ` man crush monday ' every day . this inappropriate post was then compounded by her hashtags that reveal she 's at her great grandmother 's funeral . despite ongoing bloodshed in syria , positive messages and pictures of the country 's president , bashar al-assad , are regularly uploaded to the site , with no objections from instagram\n",

            "washington ( cnn ) in 2011 , al qaeda took warren weinstein hostage . then , about a year later , his family paid money to his captors , said a pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers . it did not lead to the american aid worker 's release , and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in january , the white house announced thursday . after the transfer of funds in 2012 , the captors , who never referred to themselves as \" al qaeda , \" but instead as \" afghans , \" began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for weinstein , most prominently dr. aafia siddiqui of pakistan , the source said . she has been described as the \" poster girl \" for islamic jihad and is serving an 86-year sentence in the united states . the militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the pakistani province of waziristan , along the afghan border , the source said . the men on the other end of the phone spoke pashto with an accent typical for the border region . and they were professional in their dealings , said the source , who noticed a marked change after the money was paid . the people who had originally talked to the source about weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone . the militants also connected themselves with other terror events . after isis beheaded american james foley , weinstein 's afghan captors told the source that \" the iraqis \" were asking for the american and that they were preparing an \" orange suit \" for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when isis militants murdered them . when the taliban released u.s. army sgt. bowe bergdahl , a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of bergdahl 's kidnappers . they had said , at one point , that if they did kill weinstein , they 'd announce it in a big way , because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate . the captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012 , and the last time the source spoke with them , in early april , they said that weinstein was still alive . in spite of a request for proof of life , the militants did n't give one . after that , the calls stopped . the source never had a number for the militants ; they had always been the ones who called . the source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors , leaving the disclosure to weinstein 's family . could weinstein have been saved ? weinstein 's family in maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to congress . weinstein 's wife , elaine , and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one 's plight -- especially media attention -- would make weinstein , a government contractor working with usaid in pakistan , a more valuable hostage to his al qaeda captors . but the family switched course and went to their representatives in congress in late 2013 after a video of weinstein -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt \" totally abandoned and forgotten \" by his country . will the drone debate return ? more than a year later , that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the weinsteins and the maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed weinstein 's case with the obama administration as well as pakistan . the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one , according to one of those lawmakers and a senate aide . \" we do n't get choked up too often at work , \" algene sajery said as she held back tears . \" but this is really hard . \" sajery is a foreign policy adviser to sen. ben cardin , d-maryland , who worked closely on the case . after the white house announced that weinstein had been accidentally killed in a january u.s. drone strike , the aide 's first call was to weinstein 's daughters . \" myself and my colleague worked really closely with them , talked to them all the time ... they 're just such good people , \" sajery said of the family . \" there 's a personal connection there . \" cardin and his staff had tracked the weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in august 2011 , but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case , cardin 's staff joined forces with rep. john delaney , the weinsteins ' congressman , and began setting up meetings for the family . cardin 's staff set up meetings for the senator and weinstein 's family with everyone from the u.s. special representative to afghanistan and pakistan to the pakistani ambassador in washington . cardin and sen. barbara mikulski , d-maryland , wrote to president barack obama , calling on the u.s. to beef up efforts to secure weinstein 's release and dedicate more resources to the cause . and the staff and lawmakers helped the weinsteins weave through the network of agencies -- from the fbi to the state department and the white house -- working to bring weinstein home . \" we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated , \" delaney told cnn on thursday . \" the government is a bureaucracy , and you have to make sure that it 's working . \" but for the weinsteins and the families of other american hostages held by terror groups abroad , the government has n't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on capitol hill who worked to help them . al qaeda hostage warren weinstein killed \" unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the u.s. government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years , \" elaine weinstein said in a statement thursday . \" we hope that my husband 's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the u.s. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families . \" it 's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of american hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient u.s. government efforts to bring their loved ones home . delaney was \" saddened , disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring warren home , \" he said in a statement thursday . and in an interview with cnn later in the day , he strayed away from blaming the obama administration or people in various u.s. agencies , instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system . the weinstein family 's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when bergdahl , the u.s. army sergeant , was released by a taliban-affiliated group in exchange for five guantanamo bay prisoners . the u.s. policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception . \" it 's one of those things where it 's both there 's some hope , but at the same time it caused them some great frustration , \" delaney recalled , saying the family asked : \" why not warren ? \" but as the state department called the bergdahl exchange a \" unique situation , \" the weinsteins ' hopes were dashed . \" that 's when they asked us to really step up our efforts , \" sajery said . \" that 's when they decided to really go public . \" delaney introduced a resolution calling on the obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring weinstein home and make his return -- and that of other u.s. hostages abroad -- a top priority . mikulski , cardin and sens. dick durbin and mark kirk of illinois pushed a similar resolution in the senate . and the weinsteins took to the airwaves , with alisa weinstein appearing on cnn 's \" ac360 \" to make a public appeal for her father 's release -- and for the u.s. government to do more to secure his freedom . \" my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. bergdahl , as are all of the americans who are being held abroad , \" she said on cnn last june . \" you can not distinguish between these hostages . ... they ca n't just pick and choose , decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there . \" white house press secretary josh earnest on thursday said that \" significant resources \" were dedicated to try to free weinstein and that \" as painful as it is , \" the u.s policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more americans at risk . and state department acting spokeswoman marie harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the weinsteins throughout the process . while the u.s. policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , the state department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of american hostages held by terrorists abroad , she said . the white house announced the review last fall , which obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped americans abroad . speaking at the office of the director of national intelligence on friday , obama reiterated that the white house will review what happened . \" we all bleed when we lose an american life , \" he said . \" we all grieve when any innocent life is taken . we do n't take this work lightly . \" obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall , noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified , while only their failures become public . \" the world does n't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent , or the terrorist attacks you thwart , or the lives that you save , \" obama said . \" it can be frustrating sometimes , but that 's part of the function of our democracy . but i know what you do . \" but delaney , the weinsteins ' congressman , is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing american hostages held abroad . delaney on thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the u.s. find american hostages -- an effort he 's been pushing in recent months . the tragedy of weinstein 's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms . \" i think that every single american wants any american held hostage returned , \" delaney said . \" there 's tremendous support to do more . \" on friday , elaine weinstein said in a statement that the family has \" been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world . \" \" we appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the warren we loved so much as well as those who did not , \" the statement said . \" our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals . \" cnn 's sophia saifi reported from islamabad , pakistan ; jeremy diamond reported and wrote from washington ; saima mohsin reported from bangkok . cnn 's ben brumfield contributed to this report .\n",

' monkia brzezinska , pacskowska 's daughter-in-law , left , and bejamin khoury , who also admitted fraud , also escaped jail prosecutor peter zinner described the scam as an ` audacious and sophisticated ' attempt to steal the property , valued at about # 950,000 . he said : ` in so adopting the sole owner 's identity , purported to be the vendor of the property and instructed solicitors to sell the property for that sum and it was only the subsequent intervention of the police just before completion of the sale that prevented the property from being sold from under the owner 's feet . ' all three defendants were sentenced to two years imprisonment suspended for two years , ordered to carry out unpaid work and pay # 250 each towards prosecution costs . judge michael grieve qc added : ` it 's not easy to establish your roles in these offences . ` one is left to wonder how there could ever have been a realistic prospect of mrs pacskowska , who is polish and speaks little if any english , passing herself off as georgina bagnall-oakeley to the satisfaction of a qualified solicitor . the # 1million house in clarendon mews , bayswater , which the group had tried to sell from under owner georgina bagnall-oakley 's nose ` ms brzezinska i can only conclude that your role was to support and interpret for your mother-in-law . ` it 's absolutely clear that there were others who lay behind this fraud who would have substantially benefitted from it and who used you to open yourselves up to high risk for relatively little reward . ` you took part willingly and for financial gain and provided photographs to be used on false driving licences and passports . ` others played leading roles in this fraud which on one view was a very sophisticated property fraud . ` but your mission was doomed to failure . the victim said she was left feeling ` vulnerable , apprehensive and anxious ' after she discovered someone had tried to steal her identity to sell her home , pictured ` there was an anonymous tip-off to the solicitors who alerted the police and officers then lay in wait for you in november .

            "( cnn ) it 's only a few weeks since the first presidential announcement but already it feels like the campaign is in high gear . a number of politicians have officially announced their candidacies and the outline of their messages is starting to emerge . hillary clinton , who announced last week , even jumped into her black van for a road trip out to iowa , including a pit stop at chipotle along the way . although the campaign has barely begun , most of the candidates -- and some probable candidates -- are already starting to make mistakes . most of the mistakes will simply be blips along the way , but some of them might end up being more damaging if they feed into negative perceptions that voters have about the candidates . here are a few notable mistakes in the past few weeks : trying to separate himself from the pack , new jersey gov. chris christie called for substantial cuts to social security . he also promised to reverse the marijuana legalization laws that many states have been enacting in response to ballot initiatives . both of these statements could come back to bite him , should he run for president . while christie sees social security cuts as a way to \" go big \" in crafting a platform for a possible presidential run , as many republicans have discovered social security is a very popular program and one that has strong support from americans who are over 60 -- a big part of the electorate . on marijuana legalization , christie inserted himself into an issue that has growing public support in red and blue states , especially with the younger and independent voters who christie is promising to bring into a potential campaign . if christie continues to veer right it will be harder to sell himself as the moderate in the race , and yet there is little chance that he will secure conservative votes over someone like sen. ted cruz . sen. cruz impressed many observers when he announced his candidacy at liberty university . but soon after he did something that took many people by surprise . the texas senator , who has been one of the leading opponents of president barack obama 's health care plan , acknowledged that he would be enrolling in the affordable care act program since his wife was taking a leave of absence from her job to help with the campaign . it will be hard for him to live this one down . since he wants to sell himself as the authentic conservative and the republican who will give democrats their biggest toughest fight , the fact that he decided to join a program he has railed against -- and tied up congress with -- will raise questions about whether he is just another politician , and not a true zealot over obamacare . the decision will offer plenty of fodder to democrats who want to remind voters that republicans rail against government even when they and their constituents depend on it . if anyone faces authenticity questions , it is kentucky sen. rand paul . as the so-called \" libertarian \" in the campaign , paul is aiming to attract younger republicans who otherwise are not interested in the party . he is also hoping to bring back hard-core anti-government conservatives who believed that their party has moved too far away from their original goals . paul has already struggled to justify some of his recent announcements , such as calling for a more aggressive war against isis and his statements against gay marriage . but after announcing his presidency , he brought himself more trouble with his aggressive interaction with \" today \" host savannah guthrie . paul became clearly aggravated with what the host and went so far as go explain how to conduct the interview . the interview focused most media attention on paul 's temper and his interactions with women rather than his message . in an interview on cnbc , he put his finger to his lips and said \" shhh , calm down \" to anchor kelly evans . both moments revealed a side of his character than until that moment had been somewhat off the radar . \" you 're coming off as pretty thin-skinned in your interviews , \" megyn kelly of fox news told the senator . thus far , clinton has had a fairly smooth opening but during her first week on the trail , she did make a minor mistake . while speaking in norwalk , iowa , clinton said during a discussion about immigration reform that \" all my grandparents , you know , came over here \" even though only one was really an immigrant . her staff corrected the statements . \" her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and , as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants . as has been correctly pointed out , while her grandfather was an immigrant , it appears that hillary 's grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the u.s. in the early 1880s . \" clinton 's campaign video seemed pitch perfect to many observers , as she largely removed herself from the story line . her drive to iowa demonstrated that she is n't likely to repeat the kinds of mistakes that she made in 2008 when she failed to take the nuts and bolts of caucus organization seriously . although the entire opening certainly had the flavor of a made for television event , it has generally been well-received . clearly the biggest \" gaffe \" in the run-up to the clinton campaign was in how she handled the story of her use of a private server rather than the state department email system . although she dragged out the campaign announcement , she certainly should have had more of the team in place given how much attention she would receive . at first she stumbled in her response , giving the accusers time to spin the story as reflecting a tendency to hide information and suggesting that she was still the untruthful person so many people suspected . rubio announced his presidential run after the biggest announcement of them all : hillary clinton . given that rubio is not one of the most well-known of the candidates , outside of republican political circles , his timing was not perfect . the announcement was overshadowed by clinton 's video and drive to iowa . coming on the heels of obama 's historic discussions with cuba , the timing and sequence did n't help the senator to get the kind of initial buzz that he was hoping for . although in the long run this wo n't make a difference , it might have been wise for him to delay the announcement and give his campaign some breathing space . all of these are still relatively small missteps in the very start of the campaign . and we know from social scientists than individual gaffes and mistakes do n't really have a big impact on the outcome of these contests , so much as the \" fundamentals \" like the ability to raise campaign contributions and the endorsements from political elites . still , mistakes can play a role in campaigns . while individual mistakes might be fleeting , collectively , these kinds of moments can shape how voters think of candidates when the time comes for a vote .\n",

            "( cnn ) australia has recalled its ambassador to indonesia for consultations after two australians were among eight drug smugglers executed by firing squad early wednesday . australian prime minister tony abbott called the executions \" cruel and unnecessary \" because both men , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , had been \" fully rehabilitated \" during a decade in prison . abbott did n't say what permanent actions , if any , would be taken against indonesia . \" this is a dark moment in the relationship , but i 'm sure the relationship will be restored , \" he said . one of the men 's indonesian lawyers , todung mulya lubis tweeted his apologies . i lost , \" he said . \" i 'm sorry . \" indonesian president joko widodo appeared to shrug off the diplomatic recall , telling reporters that \" our legal sovereignty must be respected . we also respect other countries ' legal sovereignty . \" foreign minister retno marsudi said the country had no plans to recall its own ambassador in response . \" this is a legal case . this is not a political case so at this very stage , we do not have any plan to call our ambassador back from canberra , \" he said . six other inmates were executed , including nigerians raheem salami , silvester obiekwe nwolise , okwudil oyatanze and martin anderson ; indonesian zainal abidin and brazilian rodrigo gularte , who was said to be mentally ill . on wednesday , brazil 's foreign ministry released a statement expressing \" deep sadness \" at gularte 's execution , saying that brazilian president dilma rousseff had urged her indonesian counterpart to spare him due to his \" psychiatric condition . \" gularte is the second brazilian to be executed in indonesia this year , with the first -- marco archer cardoso moreira -- prompting the country to recall its ambassador for consultations . the indonesian government had originally announced that nine prisoners would be executed , but at the last moment filipina mary jane veloso was spared . \" we are so happy , so happy . i thought i had lost my daughter already but god is so good . thank you to everyone who helped us , \" her mother celia veloso told cnn . philippines embassy officials said veloso would be returned to yogyakarta prison in central java later on wednesday . no reason was given for the reprieve but it may relate to developments in her case late on tuesday . cnn philippines reported that veloso 's alleged recruiter , maria kristina sergio and her partner julius lacanilao , surrendered to authorities . the report said sergio had denied all accusations in relation to veloso 's case . veloso 's lawyers claimed the mother-of-two was the victim of human trafficking . they say she was offered work in malaysia , but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and was n't aware the bag she 'd been given for the return journey to indonesia was filled with drugs . a tenth prisoner , frenchman serge atlaoui , was also scheduled to be executed but his case was delayed while a court considers a legal challenge . candlelight vigils were held for chan and sukumaran in the hours ahead of the expected execution . the men 's legal teams had been fighting for years for a stay , but it was n't to be . the men -- then aged in their early twenties -- were arrested in 2005 as part of the \" bali nine , \" a drug smuggling gang that intended to import 8 kilograms ( 17.6 pounds ) of heroin from bali to australia . the pair were transported with other prisoners to indonesia 's so-called \" execution island \" in march , and after being given 72-hours notice of their execution on saturday , chan married his longtime girlfriend , febyanti herewila , on monday in prison . the executions of sukumaran and chan came despite the fact that both this week received a court date of may 12 to hear an outstanding legal challenge . on tuesday , lawyers for the men also said indonesia 's judicial commission had yet to properly investigate claims of corruption during their original trial and sentencing . they said three of the men 's indonesian lawyers had been summoned to attend the commission on may 7 . however , before the executions , indonesia insisted that all legal avenues had closed . on tuesday , the prisoners ' families were heard wailing as they boarded a boat for the execution site . visiting hours were extended until 8 p.m. to give them extra time before they were asked to leave . under indonesian law , the death penalty is carried out by a 12-man firing squad , although only three guns are loaded with live ammunition . prisoners are given the choice of whether to stand or sit , and whether they want to wear a blindfold , hood or nothing . the shots -- aimed at the heart -- are fired from between 5 and 10 meters ( 16 to 33 feet ) , according to amnesty international . after the executions , the rights group released a statement condemning them as \" reprehensible \" and issue fresh calls for a moratorium on the death penalty . while the bali nine have garnered much international attention , their punishment is part of a larger government effort to combat illegal drug trafficking . indonesian president widodo has insisted that indonesia would not be swayed by appeals for clemency because the country is dealing with a \" drugs crisis . \" he told cnn in january that clemency would not be extended to drug traffickers , leading to an appeal from chan and sukumaran that their cases had n't been properly considered . lawyers for the two men said they underwent radical rehabilitation during their 10 years in kerobokan prison and were helping to counsel and support other inmates . chan was ordained as a christian minister who led prayer meetings , while sukumaran became an accomplished painter and established his own art classes inside the bali prison . the indonesian government did n't confirm until late tuesday that the executions were to go ahead . preparations were clearly underway earlier that day , with the arrival of ambulances at the port where boats leave to go to nusa kambangan island where the prisoners were being held . images showed individual crosses bearing the prisoners ' names and the date april 29 , 2015 . families were in little doubt as to what lay ahead . when reports of his death emerged , sukumaran 's cousin tweeted : \" i love you more than you can imagine . your legacy will live on . save me a place in heaven . \" cnn 's tasha tampubolon contributed to this report .\n",

' the paleo advocate has been encouraging hundreds and thousands of australians to embrace the lifestyle evans 's co-authors , wellness blogger charlotte carr and naturopath helen padrin , told channel 7 last week the dangerous formula had been reworked and renamed ` happy tummy brew ' . the pair told the program the recipe had changed . ` we added vitamin c and some calcium , ` carr told the morning show . it comes after evans ' recently shared two stories on his social media accounts of women who claimed the paleo diet helped alleviate the symptoms of their multiple sclerosis . a 30-year-old woman , hollie , wrote she thought her life was over when she was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in september 2013 . she said that she endured months of constant dizziness , altered temperature perception , extreme fatigue , numbness in her legs and feet and fell into a period of depression . but after jumping on the paleo diet bandwagon , hollie claimed she has not suffered any ms symptoms over the past 12 months , her depression has gone and she feels healthier than ever . hollie 's experience led the celebrity chef to share her testimonial with his 868,000-plus followers on facebook on saturday . pete evans has shared an incredible story about a woman who claims she no longer suffers multiple sclerosis ` wow this is powerful story on ms , thanks for sharing hollie . it will make your heart sing . it has mine , please tag and share wide !

            "kiev , ukraine ( cnn ) the question haunting kiev is this : who might be murdering allies of ukraine 's ousted president viktor yanukovych ? the idea that this might be happening is not entirely new . but it muscled its way to the fore again this week with two high-profile shooting deaths in the ukrainian capital -- one of a former member of parliament with ties to yanukovych , the other of a ukrainian journalist known for his pro-russian views . oleg kalashnikov , the former member of parliament , was shot and killed shortly after 7 p.m. wednesday at the entrance to his apartment block . kalashnikov , 52 , was a member of the party of regions , the former ruling party in ukraine , and was close to yanukovych . police are investigating the death as a murder . a day later , on thursday , journalist oles buzyna , 45 , was killed near his home by shots fired from a dark blue ford focus , interior ministry adviser anton herashchenko said . the car 's license plates were reported to have been from either latvia or belorussia . the killings renewed speculation , sparked by earlier unusual deaths , about a conspiracy to kill people close to yanukovych . at least three former members of parliament with the party of regions have reportedly committed suicide in the last seven weeks : • on february 28 , mikhail chechetov reportedly jumped from the window of his 17th-floor apartment in kiev , having left a suicide note . he was suspected of having falsified the results of a parliamentary vote in early 2014 that essentially prohibited protest just as thousands of people were protesting against the yanukovych government . • on march 9 , stanislav melnik , a former member of parliament with the party of regions and the manager of several businesses in the separatist-minded eastern city of donetsk , was found dead in his apartment near kiev . he , too , reportedly left a suicide note . • and three days later , on march 12 , oleksandr peklushenko , another former member of parliament , was found in his house in zaporizhzhya , in southeastern ukraine , dead of a gunshot wound . police are investigating various scenarios , including suicide . interior ministry adviser anton gerashchenko said peklushenko \" might have wanted to avoid punishment for using violence against protesters , which he was suspected of . \" ukraine is deeply divided , and it has been for years . about a third of the population speaks russian as opposed to ukrainian . whether the country should be drawn into the orbit of russia or the west is a visceral issue , a question for many ukrainians not of politics but of identity . recent events have deepened the divide . in 2014 , after yanukovych turned his back on the european union in favor of closer ties with russia , he was driven from office by mass demonstrations . and with russia 's subsequent annexation of crimea and its support for russian-speaking separatists in eastern ukraine , the internecine animosity made the ugly transformation into war . with a government toppled and armed conflict in the east , ukrainians have reason to want each other dead . but the view of who might be responsible for the series of deaths differs starkly , according to which side of the country 's divide one is on . the opposition bloc , the country 's major opposition party , has no doubt the deaths have been politically motivated -- \" bloody terror against opposition politicians and journalists , \" the bloc 's media office called them . \" it is clear oppression of those who are not afraid to criticize the government , \" it said . the government , unsurprisingly , sees things differently . ukrainian president petro poroshenko , who came to office after yanukovych was ousted , has demanded an investigation of the killings of kalashnikov and buzyna , his media office said . \" it is evident that these crimes have the same origin , \" the media office quoted poroshenko as saying . \" their nature and political sense are clear . it is a deliberate provocation that plays in favor of our enemies . it is aimed at destabilizing the internal political situation in ukraine and discrediting the political choice of the ukrainian people . \" and anton geraschenko , an adviser to the country 's interior minister , took the theory one step further . \" it should not be excluded that the killings of oleg kalashnikov and olez buzyna were planned and organized from moscow and are a part of a plan to destabilize ukraine and further support anti-ukrainian mood in russian society , \" geraschenko said .\n",

' mr barry and his girlfriend , sabrina finn , arrived home to find the group of boys trying to get into the black of flats when they lived . ms johnson said : ` one of those boys was continually pressing the button to be let in . ` mr barry and his girlfriend said they could n't let the boys into the flat if the occupants were n't answering the buzzer . the attack happened as mr barry ( left ) returned home with his girlfriend , council worker sabrina finn ( right ) ` as mr barry used his fob to open the main entrance , it appears there was a bit of pushing and shoving between him and the boys . ` mr barry and his girlfriend entered the block and walked to the lift . ` the defendant followed mr barry into the block , along a short corridor , around a corner , and as mr barry stepped into the lift , the defendant stabbed him twice in the chest , in a completely unprovoked and cowardly attack . ' one of the boys with the killer told police he had seen his friend ` become angry and take a kitchen knife out of his rucksack . ' another of the boys saw him thrust the knife at mr barry and say : ` what are you saying now ? what are you saying now ? ' before swinging the knife at the victim . when they ran from the block of flats , the killer told a friend he had ` just ripped the man 's jacket ' . the old bailey ( pictured ) heard the boy became enraged when mr barry , who was known as jack , would not let the boy and his friends into the block of flats where he lived . he fatally stabbed mr barry twice mr barry did not initially realise he had been stabbed , but found blood on his shirt and when he entered his flat he collapsed . paramedics found him laying face down in a pool of blood , with a wound in his abdomen and another in his chest . he later died from his injuries . in texts later that night , the boy told a friend : ` i 'm going to prison ' and posted on facebook : ` the thing i 'm going to miss most when i go pen ( penitentiary ) is ny gyal ( new york girl ) . ' ms johnson said the boy also went by a street name associated with the wood green gang . ` this is a gang that he candidly admitted he was associated with since the age of ten ' , she said . the court heard the teenager was given a police caution and excluded from his first school when he was caught with a knife and cannabis in february 2013 , then aged just 11 . ms johnson said mr barry 's girlfriend , ms finn , had written an impact statement describing the ` appalling effects on her and many of mr barry 's family and friends ' . ` i 'm back at work now , but although i walk , talk , and look the same as i did before , inside i 'm tired and my heart is broken ' , she said . mr barry was stabbed following the row outside this block of flats in edmonton , north london ( pictured ) ` jack and i had four happy years together and this young boy has taken that happiness away from me . ` for that i 'm very sad and angry as my life will never been the same again . ' the boy 's mother wept in court as judge stephen kramer qc today sentenced the boy to a minimum of 11 years detention at her majesty 's pleasure . ` when mr barry returned home , he refused to let you in to that block but you nevertheless got in ' , he said . ` you followed mr barry , produced your knife , and then stabbed him twice in the chest . ` the injury to the chest went through clothing including a wax jacket and went deep . ' ` you are only 13 years old but shortly after 7.30 pm on the evening of december 14 2014 , you were carrying a knife in your bag . ` you wanted to get into a block of flats but you went to the wrong block with tragic consequences for everyone involved . ' the judge said it was an aggravating factor that the boy had taken the knife to the scene in his bag and said he had clearly intended to cause really serious harm to mr barry . the boy has been deemed a high risk of causing harm and at a medium risk of reoffending when he is released , and the judge urged him to reconsider his gang affiliation . however he also accepted it was not a premeditated attack and that the boy had a ` troubled background ' . he took into account the boy 's remorse , revealed in a letter from his mother which was not read out in court . the boy , wearing a pale blue shirt with a white buttoned up collar , showed no emotion and stared straight ahead as the sentence was passed . the teenager pleaded guilty to one count of murder on march 6 , and michael turner qc , defending , said this was a ` unique ' early admission from such a young defendant . judge kramer refused an application by the press to lift a legal ban on naming the boy , saying there were ` exceptional ' circumstances .\n",

            "( cnn ) the death of freddie gray , which was the flashpoint for the protests and now the riots in baltimore , has raised again the questions surrounding police use of force , especially after the now-familiar video of officers arresting mr. gray and loading him into a police van . gray was arrested by police on april 12 . the 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in , according to authorities . gray 's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped , and after a week of hospitalization , he died . police commissioner anthony batts has said , \" we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times . \" the police and the u.s. justice department are investigating . the case raises at least three legal issues : believe it or not , the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.in that narrative , police state \" defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence . \" according to the officers ' words , that 's the sole reason a stop was initiated . there is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns . the next sentence is important too : \" the defendant was apprehended in [ a specific location ] after a brief foot chase . \" the police are locked in : it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop , because the very next thing that happens ... is the stop . can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them ? for the most part , yes . but having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest . in this case , mr. gray took off running . the united states supreme court and maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed . when you add to the suspect 's flight the supreme court 's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion , it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop , constitutionally . much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys , as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual ( 1 ) running away , ( 2 ) in a \" high crime \" area , the stop will usually be \" good . \" but police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk . police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \" armed and presently dangerous \" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons . the charging document does n't really identify a safety concern ... or does it ? after the chase , and before an arrest : \" this officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket . \" should n't that really say : \" i saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where i could n't see it \" ? that 's a close call : police were lawfully at the stop stage , but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip ? see how artfully that was done ? observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern . i suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips , chip clips , etc. . according to william murphy , an attorney for gray 's family , he was carrying a \" pocket knife of legal size , \" and the lawyer contended that police did n't see the knife before the altercation . the legality of the knife will be an issue , but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop . the important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest . in theory , if a stop gives rise to no suspicion , and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint , the citizen should be free to leave . an arrest requires much more : probable cause to believe a crime has been committed , and nothing less . that knife was the only crime he was charged with , so again , police are locked into a narrative by their own report . if it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife , there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest . for example , if the \" knife \" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper , that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest . remember also that based on the police narrative in the report , they did not see the knife until after they seized mr. gray . so the question arises : what would they have done with gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him ? they could , but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in gray 's death . as we 've seen , charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult . if you 're pro-cop , you could say that 's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force . if you have a more jaded view of law enforcement , you would say it 's because they are well-trained , and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force . baltimore police are suggesting mr. gray 's injuries occurred after his arrest , while he was being transported back for processing , and that he may not have received proper medical attention . that 's not a surprise . in fact , from a liability perspective , this is a good strategic move for the police . it will be harder to hold them liable if gray 's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest . pre-arrest , gray 's \" seizure \" would be judged by a \" reasonableness \" standard , under the fourth amendment . however , courts have limited these \" seizures \" to the initial act of seizing the person . any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the fourth amendment . the claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision : the due process clause of the 14th amendment . what 's the difference between the fourth and 14th amendment anyway ? when it comes to potential civil liability of the officers , it makes a huge difference . the applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs . under the fourth amendment , the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances . under the 14th amendment standard , the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering . that 's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet . fortunately , courts have held that pretrial detainees like freddie gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th amendment as are convicted prisoners under the eighth amendment , and its prohibition against \" cruel and unusual punishments , \" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners . even a supreme court justice has taken issue with this view of the constitution . other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the fourth amendment after arrest , so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts , judges , and states differ , too . it 's just that maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions . it 's a kind of unintentional \" gap \" in constitutional coverage , one the courts have struggled to deal with . based on the law , it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \" rough ride , \" police might avoid liability in maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically . that 's a higher standard for liability than if freddie gray was hurt pre-arrest , so , if it 's the truth , it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one .\n",

' pardew is prepared to let star winger yannick bolasie leave for ` between 40 and 60 million pounds ' and would use the money to build a formidable squad . but even if that does not happen , pardew , whose side host relegation strugglers hull city on saturday , is adamant that he will be backed by chairman steve parish . the former newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in january and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens . pardew added : ' to be honest , the chairman is as much banging on my door as i am his . the most important thing is we get good value . ' while palace may seek to break the # 7million club transfer record set with the september 2014 arrival of james mcarthur from wigan , pardew is loath to do so lightly . palace broke their club transfer record in september 2014 when they splashed out # 7m on james mcarthur ` it is n't just about the money and is n't just about the figure that you pay , ' said pardew . ` it really is about are they better than what you have . ` therefore what is their value ? and that is what you have to gauge . ' i have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in . i think in that window just passed we bought really well , but really we have n't seen them . ' i have n't had to lean on shola ameobi , jordon mutch , chungy ( lee chung-yong ) too much really . ` and i really did think , particularly in shola , that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close . ` in a way the team have taken that equation away . ' pardew has guided palace out of the relegation mire since his january arrival , with the eagles fifth in the premier league standings on 2015 's fixtures alone . victory over hull in saturday 's selhurst park clash would rubber-stamp palace 's top-flight safety , and pardew admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind . ` there could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what i am going to do between now and the end of the year , ' he said . ' i will try and keep our professionalism together , but also look at chungy and jordon mutch and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment . ` we still have some big games though , so i have to look at that and ca n't be experimenting in some . ` it is about making sure whatever team goes out there is every bit as good as the team that has played in the last few weeks .

turan , mario suarez , gabi and koke ca n't over-run rodriguez , luka modric in midfield . atletico 's two banks of four are also very good at closing the space down for bale , ronaldo and benzema .

never tires of his ` one game at a time mantra ' ancelotti was on monday talking about the challenge being not to beat atletico but to win the 11th european cup -- the complete opposite of one game at a time . this meeting has added spice because it 's the chance for last season 's beaten finalists to avenge their victors . borusia monchengladbach had the same opportunity against liverpool in 1978 as did juventus against ajax in 1997 and inter milan against bayern munich in 2011 . simeone 's burns more calories on the touchline than some of his players while ancelotti 's activity tends to get no more anaerobic than opening another packet of chewing gum . the italian has won the lot in club football , simeone is on his way to equaling that feat -- he has already won the league and cup in spain , and the european and spanish super cups along with the europa league . he almost got the european cup last year but ancelotti denied him . for as long as the pair stay in spain their futures will be linked . diego simeone raises his players one game at a time and the games against real madrid are no difference real madrid boss carlo ancelotti and atletico boss simeone often have their careers compared the real stars against the team with no stars when real madrid were beaten 4-0 by atletico madrid in the league in february it was n't the atletico players who went out partying .

of brilliance the derbies have thrown up their fair share of great goals . ronaldo and gareth bale 's moments of brilliance have thrown up their fair share of goals in the game atletico madrid 's turkish midfielder arda turan has scored his fair share of wondergoals in his career they used to hold a sarcastic banner up behind the goal at the santiago bernabeu for the madrid derby . it was written like a classified ad and read : ` wanted -- decent rival for city derby ' . those days are long gone . atletico madrid ended a 14-year run of not beating real when they won the copa del rey against them two years ago . sergio ramos celebrates a goal against his rivals in the champions league final in portugal the game is a chance for simeone to get his own back on ancelotti for the defeat in what is to date their only meeting in european competition . although some would say with four wins and two draws in the six games in other competitions between the two since then , he has already done that . and they have n't looked back since . at the start of the season they beat them in the spanish super cup and knocked them out of the copa del rey both times over two legs . the one blip in the recent run came when it mattered most in last year 's champions league final and they will hope to put that right on tuesday night . most city derbies have one side up and the other down -- right now atletico as spanish champions and real as european champions are a match for each other in every sense . bale celebrates when it counts most as he scores in the champions league final in

' hibs defender jordon forster admitted he 'd been motivated by a desire to silence the gloating hearts fans , saying : ` as much as you try and block out what the hearts fans are planning , you see it on social media and in the papers . you know the fans are doing this and that . ` you 'd be lying if you said you do n't hear the fans during the game . i like a bit of banter because it 's the fans ' day as well as the players . you can use it to your motivation , as long as you do n't let it affect your game in a negative way . ` it 's all a bit of fun . they have won the league - but we get the bragging rights for today . the hibernian fans were in good spirits at full-time after getting one over their city rivals ` it 's probably the most important derby win i 've been involved in . my debut was special and i 'll always remember it but it was vital to get three points and keep the pressure on rangers . ` all we can do is keep winning games until the end of the season and see where it takes us . they ( rangers ) go to tynecastle at the end of the season and if we win all our games we need them to drop points somewhere . if we stay focused it could be a really good season for the club and the fans .

            "a canadian prostitute says that she wishes other people would n't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job . celine bisette , who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career , insists she is neither ` damaged ' nor ` deranged ' - that , in fact , she rather enjoys being a prostitute , and it 's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy . ' i am embarrassed to be a sex worker , even though i like my job , i 'm good at it , and i 've made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years , ' she wrote in a recent essay for xojane . this pro has pride : canadian prostitute celine bisette , pictured here , wishes other people would n't make her feel embarrassed about her job first , celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they 've made about prostitutes . she claims that she did n't have an abusive childhood , she 's not a ` hyper-sexual nympho ' , and she is n't uneducated . she had ` an incredibly fortunate upbringing ' , she said , adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister : ' [ it was ] just about the best any child could possibly hope for . ' then , as a 19-year-old college sophomore , she found herself in need of a way to pay for school . a minimum-wage job would n't earn her enough money , and she did n't want to take out student loans . her best option , she said , was the sex industry . ' i could n't bring myself to do porn , and i knew was n't talented enough to be a stripper , ' she explained . working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for celine , as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills . it just did n't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision . in the beginning , she 'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work . she was still out-going then , she said , and never felt self-conscious . but peoples ' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job . they would lecture her , insult her , and accuse her of being a ` traitor to feminism ' . one friend told everyone in their social circle that celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career , and might have even been molested as a child . the rumor took off , and celine lost a lot of friends in the process . now , after about a decade in the industry , she is much more reticent about revealing what she does , for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions . but while she has a ` mainstream ' part-time job that she uses as a ` cover ' , she finds it frustrating that she ca n't be more open . ' i wish i could feel proud of who i am and what i do , ' she said . ` i 'm tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed . ' sexy and smart : celine , who wants to keep her real identity a secret , says she 's more than just an escort - she also has her master 's degree in sociology even when she does tell people about her work as an escort , celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master 's degree in sociology : ' i hype it up and draw attention to it , as if to say , \" yes , i 'm a [ prostitute ] , but i 'm also smart and normal , really , i promise ! \" ' because of the social stigma , she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy , her schedule is flexible , and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study . plus , she explained , she ca n't erase her history in the sex industry . ' i will always be seen as damaged goods , whether i am a current sex worker or a former one . so i might as well just keep going , right ? ' in fact , despite liking her job , it 's not canada 's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give celine pause - being paid for sex is legal , but living off that payment of it is not . rather , it 's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all . ' i wish i 'd known what i was getting myself into before i jumped into this line of work , ' she said . ` but most of all , i wish i 'd never become a prostitute in the first place . '\n",

            "boston ( cnn ) dzhokhar tsarnaev 's bombs tore through their bodies : singeing flesh , shattering bones , shredding muscles and severing limbs . but on tuesday , jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead . now that he has been found guilty on every count , the jury must decide whether boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , 21 , should live or die for what he has done . this is the victim impact part of the case , and the testimony was heartbreaking . four young people are gone , and grief fills the spaces they once occupied . a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called \" princess . \" \" krystle was the light of my life . she was extremely smart , hardworking , beautiful , every father 's dream . i miss her a lot , \" said william a. campbell sr. , dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter , a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 boston marathon . she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations , he said . \" nobody fills that boot now . \" others are expected to come and cry for lingzi lu , \" a jolly soul , \" assistant u.s. attorney nadine pellegrini said , quoting the slain chinese grad student 's father . more tears will be shed for martin richard , who was 8 and looked just like his dad . and for sean collier , who was remembered at his memorial service by these words : \" big heart , big smiles , big service . \" dzhokhar tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain , they had time to be scared and frightened , but they had no time to say good-bye , \" pellegrini told the jury . \" and that is the very essence of terror . \" timeline of bombings , manhunt and aftermath to understand the toll tsarnaev 's bombs took , jurors must know the stories of his victims , the prosecutor said . \" these young women , this young man and this little boy , all of them were loved and they loved in return , \" pellegrini said . \" before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable , they were sons , they were daughters , they were grandchildren , they were brothers and they were sisters . \" jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling , happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings . there was the photo of campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit . and then came the one that made her father smile through his tears . she was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform . \" she traded that in for a bat , \" campbell said . \" she was n't really a girly girl , but she loved to whitewater , camp , play baseball . she had a good arm on her . i was very proud of her . \" by contrast , jurors also were left with an indelible image of tsarnaev , taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held . it is dated july 10 , 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the boston marathon . he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a profane salute . \" this is dzhokhar tsarnaev , unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged , \" pellegrini said . \" without remorse , he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused . \" tsarnaev saw the people he killed as \" the enemy , \" she said . as a result , two women and a man never reached the age of 30 , and a little boy never made it to the third grade . \" he knew they were innocents . he even called them that , \" pellegrini added , referring to the message tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings . \" but it did n't stop him from murdering them . \" the people who were maimed by tsarnaev 's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks . the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of tsarnaev 's trial . when the first of the two bombs went off , gillian reny , a senior in high school , was standing near the woman she came to know was krystle campbell . \" there was a complete , utter chilling silence and then chaos . chaos like i 'd never seen and never hope to see again , \" she said . the force of the blast knocked her to the ground . when she looked around , she saw blood and muscle everywhere . her shin bone had snapped and was protruding . it was the most horrifying image i could imagine . just seeing that on my own body , \" she said , and began to cry . \" i remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere , blood everywhere . \" looking down at the blood i was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone , \" she said . \" i was terrified that i was going to die . i did not know that i could be that injured and survive . \" she said she began to scream . her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown . doctors were able to save reny 's leg , but others were n't so lucky . celeste corcoran lost both legs , one below the knee and the other above the knee . an amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from , jurors have learned at this trial . corcoran was at the finish line , waiting for her sister to cross . \" and then our whole world just exploded , \" she said . \" i unfortunately remember every single detail . \" she remembers being knocked to the ground , hearing nothing and then screams , and seeing blood everywhere . \" it 's kind of hard to explain but i want to get it right for all of you to understand , \" she told the jury . she said it was \" a surreal , out-of-body experience . \" she remembers thinking , \" what was that ? \" and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes . her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack . by then , she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined . she wondered if she would die . \" it hurt too much . i just did n't care , \" she said . \" i remember thinking i was going to die , that no one could go through that much pain . i knew it was very bad and i was thinking , ` is this it ? am i going to die ? ' i remember thinking i wanted to die . the pain was too much . i wanted to die . \" and then , she said , \" the mom in me \" took over . she remembers telling herself : \" ` hell no , i do n't want to die . i have too much living to do . do n't let this be the end . this ca n't be the end . ' \" she remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital , even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs . \" can i get on with my life ? absolutely , \" she said . but she can never forget she 's a double amputee . \" there 's always a level of discomfort . right now i 'm not comfortable , \" she said from the witness stand . \" the bottoms of my limbs , there 's this constant numb burning sensation . the only way i can describe it is it 's like you have the worst athlete 's foot in my life . \" sometimes , she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be . \" you do n't realize until you 're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are , \" she said . \" inclines are very hard . \" daily life is literally an uphill battle . cnn 's greg botelho contributed to this report .\n",

            "( cnn ) an amnesty international report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women 's rights activists in afghanistan . the report , entitled \" their lives on the line , \" examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women 's rights not only by the taliban and tribal warlords , but also by government officials . the brutal murder of farkhunda , a young woman in afghanistan , whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in kabul , shocked the world . accused of burning pages from the muslim holy book , the quran , many protested the 27-year-old 's innocence . but what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history , women in afghanistan became pallbearers , hoisting the victim 's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves , under the gazes of men ; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women 's solidarity as they marched along the streets . in a country ranked in 2011 by a thomson reuters foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women , this feminist act seemed perilous . latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard . in 2013 , the u.n. assistance mission in afghanistan ( unama ) released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20 % from the previous year , although the number of civilian victims had decreased , said amnesty in the report . the special representative of the u.n. secretary-general in afghanistan at the time , jan kubis , told the u.n. security council that \" the majority ( of women killed ) is linked to domestic violence , tradition , culture of the country . \" women activists have been deliberately targeted . \" and according to the human rights group , little support has come from those in power . \" the afghan government has done very little to protect them , \" amnesty 's afghanistan researcher , horia mosadiq , tells cnn . \" perpetrators almost always walk free , and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored . \" many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities , it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded . \" during the attack on farkhunda , \" many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed , \" says mosadiq . twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack , but she argues that this is insufficient . \" suspending police officers is not enough , those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence . \" but what is striking is the resilience of the activists , who continue their work despite their lives being on the line . \" it was a remarkable moment , \" says mosadiq , recalling the female protesters at farkhunda 's funeral . \" unlike anything i have seen in my decades of campaigning for women 's rights in our country . \" selay ghaffer , 32 , is a women 's rights activist and spokesperson for the solidarity party of afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy , social justice and women 's rights . the party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice . taking part in farkhunda 's funeral and protests against her death , she tells cnn that despite the onslaught of violence against afghan women over the years , this was the worst case . but the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message . \" so the women of afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore ... and we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women , \" said ghaffer . \" so this is why we decided to carry the dead body of farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that ( a ) man has to do this job . \" surprisingly , she says that male onlookers supported their mission , although they are in the minority overall in the country . \" men ( at the funeral ) , they said you have to do this , because this is how you can change the hatred in afghanistan . \" without men , it is not possible for women to get their rights , \" she says . \" so these men and women were working together . but at the same time , women need to step forward for their rights . \" mosadiq says the fight for women 's rights was established a while ago . \" women 's activism in afghanistan is nothing new -- the women 's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001 , and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains . \" these gains are under threat now , however , and some are even rolled back . it 's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen . \" ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work , received through emails and phone calls , at her home and office . but she says she knew what she was getting herself into . \" i knew it was n't an easy task . there might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights . \" as a woman , i want to struggle more ( for my rights ) , i want to have more people around me , to struggle with me . \" mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution , although the response to farkhunda 's killing , from both men and women , has been a \" silver lining . \" ghaffer , however , believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving . interestingly , it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight . \" i must say strongly that it was my father ( who inspired me ) , who is not any more with me , because he ... died three months ago , \" she says . \" he always told me that women always suffered in this country , \" she says , her voice overcome with emotion . \" and you have to struggle for your rights . because in this traditional , patriarchal society , nobody will give these rights ( to ) you . \" she realizes how lucky she is , she adds , in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models . ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women , not least to the victim of the recent , horrific mob violence . \" so if i should not do it , if another sister is not doing it , then who will do it ? who will get the rights for us ? we have to struggle for it . \" if we keep our silence , more farkhundas will be killed in this country . \"\n",

            "( cnn ) mullah mohammed omar is \" still the leader \" of the taliban 's self-declared islamic emirate of afghanistan . that appears to be the primary message of a biography , just published by the taliban , of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s . the taliban 's \" cultural commission \" released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghanistan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghans swore allegiance to omar . several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of omar 's demise . \" there have been a lot of rumors lately about him . some people are saying that he is not alive , \" said sayyed muhammad akbar agha , a former taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement . \" i think the taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present , \" agha told cnn in a telephone interview . bergen : why u.s. must stay in afghanistan past 2016 the biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the afghan 's jihadi leadership credentials , at a time when isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi has declared himself \" caliph \" of the world 's muslims . \" the taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment , \" said graeme smith , a kabul-based analyst for the international crisis group . \" another caliph has announced himself to the world , and the taliban has been silent . and that is getting noticed by militants across south asia . \" omar was famously camera-shy during the taliban 's six-year rule over most of afghanistan . to this day , there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader . \" he never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns . he never used the internet , \" said rahimullah yusufzai , a pakistani journalist and expert on afghanistan who once interviewed osama bin laden . omar then all but disappeared after a u.s.-led bombing campaign routed the taliban from kabul in 2001 . washington has offered a $ 10 million reward for his capture . the taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding . but years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that omar may have died . the biography challenges rumors of omar 's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule , which begins with prayers , study of the quran , and then delivering \" orders in a specific way to his jihadi commanders . \" the publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant 's early years , including the detail that his \" preferred weapon of choice \" was the rpg-7 , a rocket-propelled grenade . according to the biography , omar was born in 1960 in a village called chah-i-himmat in afghanistan 's kandahar province . his father , a \" well-known and respected erudite and social figure , \" died only five years later , apparently of natural causes . omar studied at a religious school , or madrassa , run by his uncle . the rise of the communist party in afghanistan , and the subsequent 1979 soviet invasion , interrupted the young man 's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen . for the next decade , omar commanded rebel groups \" against the invading russians and their internal communist puppets , \" according to the biography . along the way , he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye . in one battle , the biography claims , omar and a fighter named mullah biradar akhund destroyed four soviet tanks , even though they were armed with only four rpg rounds . the taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the u.s. , allied with saudi arabia and pakistan , helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989 . afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in kabul collapsed in 1992 . the movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power . the taliban biography says that omar and his compatriots \" launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy \" after an initial meeting in kandahar in june 1994 . two years later , the taliban captured kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of islamic law on the rest of the country . while the document denounces the taliban 's post-9 / 11 overthrow at the hands of a u.s.-backed coalition of rival afghan fighters , it makes no mention of the taliban 's alliance with bin laden and al qaeda . during a decade in exile , the saudi-born bin laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by u.s. raid on his hideout in the pakistani city of abbottabad in 2011 . though taliban militants have continued to battle the u.s.-backed government across afghanistan , omar has not been seen or heard from in years . the movement claims he continues to oversee a taliban leadership council , judiciary and nine executive commissions , as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of afghanistan . exclusive : isis ` recruits afghans ' in chilling video cnn 's masoud popalzai contributed to this report

' the court also heard how eight months after the schoolgirl 's disappearance , ewing 's friend , gareth dewhurst , 46 , was overheard in conversation saying he had used his car to dump the teenager 's body . mr cummings said : ` he then went on to say : \" i did n't want to have sex with her , they made me \" . ' the prosecutor said a ` highly stoned ' dewhurst told a 16-year-old boy that ewing had killed paige and had then made him have sex with her before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body . mr cummings said : ` he ( dewhurst ) said that he had put the body in the boot and was saying that he was going to set his car on fire . he was frightened that he was going to get arrested , or that bob ( ewing ) would kill him . ' paige ( right ) was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home ( left ) and , despite appeals from police and a # 12,000 reward offer from tv host jeremy kyle , no trace of her has ever been found detectives hunting for paige chivers , who vanished in suspicious circumstances more than seven years ago , dug up a farmer 's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found an extensive proof of life inquiry has not found any evidence paige is alive and she has yet to claim a ` significant ' inheritance sum left to her on her mother 's death once she turned 18 , the jury heard . the prosecutor said : ` the prosecution say that even though no body has been recovered , you can be sure that paige chivers is dead . ' the court heard that paige 's father reported her missing on august 26 and clearly stated she was 15 , but her date of birth was wrongly entered on the police system as 1962 . ` in consequence , the matter was dealt with as though paige were an adult aged 45 who had moved on voluntarily , rather than a girl of 15 who was worryingly missing from home , ' said mr cummings . that approach was not corrected until september 7 when police inquiries then commenced , he added . ewing , formerly of blackpool , denies murder and intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations . dewhurst , of blackpool , denies sexual penetration of a corpse and assisting an offender in disposing of a body . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .\n",

            "could these be the boots of a disembodied samurai soldier , lingering mysteriously behind this little girl ? a spooky dark visage that appears behind the child in this photograph has sparked online rumours of a ghost . this photograph was captured in kanagawa prefecture , japan - ` nearby some samurai tombs ' , apparently - late last year . the reddit user who posted it online - a friend of the photographer - insisted it was ` not photoshopped ' and that paranormal forces could be at work . ` i 'm not saying it 's anything - just that it looks an awful lot like disembodied boots and legs ... ' ` obiaruf ' told users . a trick of the light or paranormal forces at play ? there is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is eerie : a pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there the reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure he then suggested they appeared to be ` samurai boots to me ' . ' i know there are several very old samurai tombs nearby . ` again , not saying that this is what is there , just that , based on preliminary research , this is my best guess ... ' photographs from the same set show the little girl with nothing behind her and the snapper ` swears ' there was nothing behind her at the time . in this picture from the same set , no one appears to be standing behind this little girl however , in this other picture , the black boots have returned another conspirator suggested they could be combat boots from the world war ii era . ` my grandfather was in the pacific theater ( okinawa japan ) in wwii and i recognize what the man in the background is wearing . its a us navy uniform from wwii . ' but not everyone was so convinced by the tricky picture . some users suggested it was likely an optical illusion - a trick of the light - or the presence of a real-life human being . ` looks like a living person in boots and dark pants and a light blue , possibly denim colored shirt , ' said jack_shid . sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl ` because of the perspective , the rest of the person is hidden behind the girl last month , a chilling image emerged on the ` toowoomba ghost chasers ' facebook past , with its owner claiming it showed the ghost on a young drowning victim . the photograph , which was taken in 2014 , was posted on facebook by australian kim davison , from queensland . social media users are claiming that the white shape at the back of the image , circled , shows a ghostly face photo was taken at murphy 's hole which is the same location 13-year-old doreen o'sullivan drowned in 1915 was it doreen o'sullivan ' ghost ? ms davison claims her daughter 's leg was grabbed by something in the water the image appeared to show two women and four children swimming at murphy 's hole in the lockyer river , south-east queensland . but ms davison and jessie lu , the other adult in the photo , were adamant they were only accompanied by three children . it provoked fierce discussion online after it was revealed a little girl had died in the watering hole a century prior . a brisbane courier newspaper clipping from november 22 1913 included a death notice for a little girl who died in that watering hole . ` doreen o sullivan , aged 13 years , eldest daughter of mr. james o'sullivan was accidentally drowned whilst bathing in the lockyer creek on friday afternoon , ' the notice read . ` nearly an hour elapsed , before the body was recovered . the spot , which has always been considered dangerous , is known as murphy 's hole , and is over 20 foot deep . ms davison insisted : ` at the time of taking this photo there was nothing between us . ` i 'm holding the little girl and that white head next to me with horns is not human , i can promise you that . ` its fingers are on my shoulder and on my daughter 's arm . they are long skeletal type fingers . ' an admin from the toowoomba ghost chasers facebook page posted a negative version of the image , saying : ` light flare will always show up as black shadowing when the photo is inverted . and in this case the light flare is coming from full sunlight reflecting off the water onto the child ' tragic doreen o'sullivan was only 13 when she accidentally drowned in the swimming hole in 1915 disturbingly , ms davison claims that there had been strange occurrences that day as they swam in the water , which only firms her belief that a spirit was present . ` on this day my daughter had her leg grabbed two times by something in the water . ' ` when i went back in for one last dip to cool off i did feel something behind me as i was walking out of water but tried to ignore it . ms davison was convinced the shadowy visage in the photograph was doreen o'sullivan 's photograph . a sceptic responded to ms davison 's claims , pointing out another possibility . ` the eye sees what it wants to see . in my opinion , it 's nothing more than a splash of water , ' wrote max meara . ` notice the child facing away from the camera - their left arm has just surfaced , causing a splash . ' brad glynn had another explanation : ' i think it is another kid just the sun is over exposed more on the face as they are facing the sun .

' ms davison posted the photo on the toowoomba ghost chasers facebook page the administrators were shocked by the photo , writing ` we used to swim there all the time growing up and all i can say is just to be safe i 'm never swimming there again ! ' ms davison claims that two paranormal experts looked at the photograph and after extensive investigation came to the conclusion that the shape in the image is a child who drowned in the river in 1915 ms davison was also of the opinion that the figure in the photo was a demon who tried to take her daughter the spot , which has always been considered dangerous , is known as murphy 's hole , and is over 20 foot deep\n",

            "rory mcilroy 's official coronation will come at augusta national on sunday if he wins the masters to complete the career grand slam and consign the tiger woods era to the history books . the king is dead ; long live the king . long to reign over us . or should that be rain over us ? the heavy downpours that drenched augusta on tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous wags . but northern ireland 's world no 1 would be forgiven if he had grinned from ear to ear . that 's because each of mcilroy 's four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week . wet conditions hand mcilroy a massive advantage : his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles . shorter hitters or those with low ball flight , meanwhile , will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back . rory mcilroy shields himself from the rain on tuesday - but a wet course will play into his hands augusta national looks at its finest in the sun , but the world no 1 has won all of his four majors after rain and that is no good at augusta , where precise approaches are vital to the most strategically demanding greens in major championship golf . last year 's trio of fred couples ( 66-1 for 20th ) , miguel angel jimenez ( 150-1 for 4th ) and bernhard langer ( 400-1 for 8th ) will be tough to match that this time round , but here goes ... patrick reed ( 40-1 ) -- brash , proud of it and born to show off on the biggest stage . only his second masters but played augusta national many times as a college student . tiger woods ( 45-1 ) -- ok , so no-one knows which woods will turn up , but this could be one of the all-time cheeky punts . practice form and rededication to the game are promising signs . paul casey ( 70-1 ) -- back to near his best after finally getting fully fit and committing to play full time in the us . fifth-best on the pga tour in par-five scoring -- crucial at augusta . since the work done to ` tiger-proof ' the course in the noughties , the home of the year 's first major has become a bomber 's course . bubba watson , with two wins in three years , adam scott and angel cabrera are all big-hitting recent champions , but examine the list of leaderboards in recent years and you 'll find them dominated by players whose favourite club in the bag is driver . mother nature looks set to smile on mcilroy again this week with heavy rain forecast , particularly on friday and saturday . if that happens , the number of players who can win reduces dramatically . three-time champion phil mickelson ( 28-1 ) and england 's former us open winner justin rose ( 45-1 ) are tempting at their prices , but neither have hit their top form this year , so would be backed based on gut feeling rather than cold hard facts . the likes of jordan spieth ( 10-1 ) , zach johnson ( 100-1 ) , ian poulter ( 80-1 ) and jamie donaldson ( 125-1 ) have the brains and skill sets to get the job done . woods ( 45-1 ) must be included in that group too , despite having no form , providing the chipping yips do not strike again . but they will all have to be at the very top of their games for the entire week to compete with the boom-boom brigade . bubba watson 's power has taken him to two masters victories , but his last title defence ended badly tiger woods has the skill set to succeed for a fourth time at augusta , but he must answer big questions mcilroy ( 6-1 ) heads that pack , closely followed by watson ( 11-1 ) . australia 's jason day ( 14-1 ) and adam scott ( 20-1 ) , and sweden 's henrik stenson ( 22-1 ) are joined by american gunslingers dustin johnson ( 16-1 ) and jimmy walker ( 22-1 ) as the big hitters who have shown best form so far this year . the masters , played on the modern-day augusta , is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified : long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket . brooks koepka ( 5-1 ) -- it 's always tough to know how a player with no experience of augusta will take to the place , but this monster-hitter looks to have the perfect game . the 24-year-old american globetrotter has won the phoenix open to the turkish airlines open in the last six months . scott , the 2011 champion , has made a late switch back to his long putter , which does not bode well . stenson has been battling the flu , which either rules him out or makes him more dangerous , depending on whether you believe the old adage : ` beware the wounded golfer ' . but what makes day , johnson and walker so appealing is that each has claimed at least one big win already this year on courses that favour big hitters . day ( torrey pines ) , walker ( pebble beach ) and johnson ( doral ) have shown they possess the perfect mix of long driving , precise iron control and dead-eyed putting under the heat of competition . that is the perfect recipe for a masters champion . their only problem is that mcilroy has used it to taste success on four occasions in majors , and watson two , while they are all still waiting to dine at the top table . jason day has a brilliant record at augusta and the final step left for the australian to take is victory dustin johnson 's colossal power means he has the weapon most needed to conquer augusta jimmy walker chips onto the second green during practice , and could be set for a big week but the pressure is mounting on mcilroy as he bids for golfing immortality . watson , meanwhile , could only finish 50th in defence of his title two years ago and could be rusty after a month off . and given he finished second on his masters debut in 2011 , third two years later and 10th 12 months ago despite battling a broken thumb , sunday could be a perfect day for australia and the man who has long looked to be golf 's next major champion . course : augusta national golf club , par 72 , 7435 yards . defending champion : bubba watson ( 11-1 ) bookies ' favourite : rory mcilroy ( 6-1 )\n",

' she added : ` how dare you make the execution of black men in america the butt of your jokes ' . another quipped : ` what 's funny ? others lined up to condemn the bookmakers describing the tweet as ` deplorable ' , ` unbelievable ' , ` horrible ' and ` disgusting ' . last week , white south carolina police officer michael slager was charged with the murder of walter scott , a black man , who was filmed running away from the officer . mourners at mr scott 's funeral service were told by the pastor that his death was the result of ` overt ` racism ' . this is not the first time paddy power - who employs harriet harman 's son , harry dromey as its ` mischief champion ' - has courted controversy . paddy power 's controversial advert about the outcome of the oscar pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in britain last year . it offered ` money back if he walks ' for punters betting on the outcome of the trial . after receiving 5,525 complaints , the advertising standards authority ( asa ) pulled the advert on the grounds it trivialised ` the issues surrounding a murder trial , the death of a woman and disability . ' pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing girlfriend reeva steenkamp , although he could be released this year . criticism : paddy power 's controversial advert about the outcome of the oscar pistorius murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in britain last year earlier this year , the bookmakers attracted criticism for an advertising campaign poking fun at foreign owners of british football clubs by featuring a team of players wearing middle eastern robes . in the past , it has been derided for an advert showing a cat being kicked into a tree by a blind footballer . it was the most complained about advert of 2010 , but was cleared by the asa and did not face a ban . paddy power also created 2002 's most complained-about advert , with a campaign that placed odds on two elderly women making it across the road safely . on that occasion , it was banned by the asa . last year , the bookmakers sponsored us basketball star dennis rodman to make a controversial trip to north korea to hand over gifts to kim jong-un . this included an irish whiskey set - reportedly worth thousands of pounds - which was given as a birthday present for the north korea dictator , in response to the latest furore , a spokesman for paddy power said : ` it 's clearly an acerbic reference to recent police activity in the us . and obviously , no offence was meant .

' thing of beauty : the model t is an icon , but with a top speed of 45mph - if going downhill with a following wind - drivers can not get anywhere very fast germans may have invented the petrol engine , but it was henry ford , a michigan-irish farmer used his genius to realise its social potential . ford said he had to invent his ` gasoline buggy ' to escape the crushing boredom of his own life on the farm in the united states . the model t was made from 1908 to 1927 and is generally regarded as the first affordable car . in total more than 15million were made . the first model ts were fairly expensive , about # 500 . but by the early 1920s , when millions were being produced , the price had dropped to about # 125 , which was roughly equivalent to the average annual wage . ford was obsessed with efficiency : his production lines were inspired by the meat-packing yards of chicago and it became the first mass produced car in the united states his famous decree that customers could choose ` any colour so long as it is black ' was not to limit consumer choice , but to reduce costs . in ford 's day , freshly painted cars were left in the sun to dry . black dried more quickly and was thus cheaper . by 1914 , a model t could be manufactured in 93 minutes and spare parts were all available through the sears roebuck mail-order catalogue for drivers to install themselves .\n",

            "johnny manziel has been released from rehab . after checking into a facility on january 28 and stating that he wanted to ` be a better family member , friend and teammate , ' the cleveland browns quarterback is out and ready to begin offseason workouts with the team , which begin on april 20 . this as many are still wondering what future the highly touted athlete will have in the nfl . johnny manziel ( above ) has been released from rehab after entering a facility on january 28 this after manziel 's partying had been a topic of conversation since his rookie season began last july , with some worried his drinking was a priority manziel 's hard-partying and off-the-field antics were well known while he was in college according to espn , manziel was ` doing great ' in rehab , and had the full support of his team . now comes the real test however , as he will be forced to compete with josh mccown for the starting quarterback position , who just signed a $ 14 million contract with the team that covers the next three seasons . this after a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts , manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the end of the cleveland browns season last december , but talk soon turned to whether or not the accomplished footballer might have a problem . especially after one incident last year when , after partying until well past midnight , manziel , who is suffering from an injured hamstring , skipped out on a saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept , and in turn was fined by the browns . manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior , saying ; ` it 's about being accountable ... instead of looking like a jackass . ' and while his season may have been over at that time , many believed manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of that controversy , which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at fdr lounge at the delano in miami on over the new year holiday , alongside the likes of lebron james and ryan phillippe , and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle while sitting poolside with girlfriend colleen crowley and some buddies poolside at the delano . at this point , some in the sports world , chief among them columnist skip bayless , began to suggest that the heisman trophy winner needed to get help for his drinking . the aqthlete was in treatment for roughly six weeks before being released appearing on espn 's first take , bayless , a noted supporter of manziel , did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking . ` my concern , i repeatedly said , was if johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol , and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails , then i 'm going to be out , ' said bayless . ` in talking to people in and around the cleveland browns , i believe johnny manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol . and i believe ... that it is time for johnny to get some help . he continues to lie to his executives , to his coaches , to his teammates , to the media , and most of all , he continues to lie to himself . ' he then said he would label manziel an ` alcoholic . ' manziel was known for his partying while at texas a&m , but said he was a changed man during the 2014 nfl draft , noting that he had ` grown up , ' before being selected 22nd overall by cleveland . just days into his training with the browns however , the local press began calling him out on his partying , which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field . a source told cleveland.com at the time ; ` team officials had bought into manziel 's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in college station , texas , and they 've been stunned by his non-stop antics . ' a photo snapped of manziel before the start of the season and later posted to instagram showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter manziel while the 2013 heisman trophy as the quarterback of the texas a&m university aggies also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of manziel and later posted to instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter , leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine . browns head coach mike pettine spoke to manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted , a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the nfl , and said he felt that things were back on track and that manziel was focused on football once again . there was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building , and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident , it was the fan who was inebriated , not manziel . it should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by espn in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college , manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem , seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks . manziel would later claim this report was false , and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college . manziel is now set to begin offseason workouts with the cleveland browns on april 20 as for his future with the browns , that is a little unclear . some , including espn 's pat mcmanamon , have called on the browns to fire manziel after he overslept for his treatment last year , saying he and fellow player josh gordon have a ` complete lack of professionalism . ' gordon was also out with manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through , an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season . currently , manziel has a four year contract with the browns worth about $ 8.25 million . the 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted , and lucrative , endorsement deals in the sports world with , among others , nike , mcdonald 's , musclepharm , and snickers . for now though , manziel seems to be committed to laying low and focusing on the football . ` when [ manziel ] is back , it will be full speed ahead for him , said pettine . ' i think he 's very anxious at this point . we 'll be prepared as we will with every other player . when they get back to town , we 're going to coach the heck out of them . '\n",

friday during court hearings in washington , d.c. , that will ultimately determine whether and under which conditions john hinckley jr. will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital . giorgi-guarnieri said hinckley should be allowed to start the band but not perform publicly . one of hinckley 's interests is music , and he sings and plays the guitar . he also participates in music therapy . john hinckley jr , in 2014 , the would-be assassin of president ronald reagan , pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades at his mother 's virginia home secret service agents and bystanders attend to those injured in the assassination attempt on ronald reagan by john hinckley jr on march 30 , 1981 . hinckley 's lawyers said mental illness drove the then 25-year-old hinckley to shoot the president in an effort to impress actress jodie foster hinckley 's lawyer and treatment team say he 's ready to live full time at his 89-year-old mother 's home in virginia under certain conditions . hinckley has been allowed freedom in stages . he spends 17 days a month at his mother 's williamsburg home . if the man who shot president reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good , he should have to live under strict conditions , wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a gps tracking device , government lawyers said on thursday . hinckley 's attorney , barry levine , said on wednesday on the first day of hearings that hinckley is ` clinically ready ' to live permanently outside the hospital , a position supported by his treatment team . levine said that the mental illness that drove the then 25-year-old hinckley to shoot the president in 1981 in an effort to impress actress jodie foster has been in ` full and stable remission ' for more than two decades . but levine and government lawyers disagree about the conditions hinckley should have to comply with if he is allowed to live full-time outside of st. elizabeth 's mental hospital in washington , his home since a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting . prosecutors have proposed about three dozen conditions if hinckley lives permanently at his mother 's home in williamsburg . hinckley in his police mugshot in 1981 after he shot president reagan . he has been allowed his freedom in stages following the assassination attempt president reagan with wife nancy at george washington university hospital four days after the assassination attempt on him in 1981 those restrictions include monitoring software on the home 's computer and a ban on searching for information about : himself , reagan , foster , and reagan press secretary james brady , who also was injured in the shooting . prosecutors also want him prohibited from setting up social media accounts on sites such as facebook and linkedin , at least partly because he has been diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder , though his doctors say its effects have diminished . hinckley 's lawyers and the hospital oppose many of the restrictions . vj hyde , one of the people involved with hinckley 's case at st. elizabeths , testified on thursday that it could be helpful for hinckley to explore information about himself , including news stories and information about the shooting and the people he hurt . hyde also said the hospital ` adamantly opposes ' requiring hinckley to wear an ankle monitor . hyde said ` many people do n't recognize ' hinckley anymore , and he said the monitor would further stigmatize him . the judge overseeing hinckley 's case , u.s. district judge paul l. friedman , previously rejected prosecutors ' request to have hinckley wear an ankle monitor during the 17-day visits to his mother 's home . freedom for hinckley , who turns 60 next month , has come gradually . for a dozen years , friedman has allowed him increasing freedom , with the purpose of reintegrating him into society . friedman first agreed in 2003 that he could have day visits with his family in the washington area , then local overnight visits . visits with his parents in williamsburg followed . those were expanded to 17 days by the judge in late 2013 . it will ultimately be up to friedman whether to let hinckley live full time in williamsburg and , if so , under what conditions . some of the conditions attorneys are discussing are ones hinckley already complies with while in williamsburg and which both sides agree on : carrying a gps-enabled cellphone , not talking to the media , and attending individual and group therapies . the u.s. secret service also keeps watch on hinckley now and then , but it 's not a condition of his release . scott hinckley , brother of john hinckley , arrives at the federal courthouse in dc on wednesday for the hearing on whether his sibling should spend more time outside the mental institution that he was sentenced to

' richard stein , his solicitor , said : ` gchq unlawfully spied on privileged legal communications for years , and the secret oversight mechanisms failed to stop it . ` this marks the end of gchq 's standard boilerplate response that its activities are lawful , necessary and proportionate . i am sure that the unlawful behaviour we have uncovered in this case is the tip of the iceberg . ' cori crider , of legal charity reprieve , which represented the families , said : ` gchq spied on privileged legal communications , in a case where they were being sued by a rendition and torture victim . ` we are pleased that one man has finally beaten the security services in this secretive tribunal . but this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child 's play , because it rigs the whole justice game in the government 's favour . ' the ipt 's ruling said that two documents involving al-saadi ` contained material subject to the legal professional privilege ... held by gchq ' . it added : ` in order to emphasise the importance of the protection of legally privileged material the tribunal has required gchq to give an undertaking that the parts of the documents containing legally privileged information will be destroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future . ' the ipt rejected similar claims to mr al saadi 's made by other libyan claimants , including abdel hakim belhadj ( pictured ) , another prominent anti-gaddafi campaigner mr al saadi was kidnapped with his family in hong kong in 2004 , and tortured after his rendition to libya following what he claims was a tip-off by mi6 . he was eventually freed and returned to britain where he began legal action against the government . in december 2012 britain agreed to pay mr al saadi # 2 million in compensation in an out of court settlement . however , the government did not admit liability for the rendition to libya in 2004 , nor confirm that mi6 was involved . mr belhadj is currently suing the uk over the same scandal . he insists he was tortured during six horrific years in jail , including being beaten and hung from hooks on the walls . the former islamist rebel , now a prominent politician in tripoli , has spurned a seven-figure settlement and wants an admission of guilt and an apology from britain . last october , the court of appeal heard claims that the british government under tony blair was complicit in the arrest of mr belhadj and his wife at bangkok airport in 2004 . his legal battle raises the extraordinary prospect of mr straw and sir mark allen , a former senior mi6 spy , being hauled before the courts to give evidence . a government spokesman said : ` we welcome the tribunal 's confirmation today that the intelligence agencies did not seek or gain any advantage in legal proceedings and , in fact , held no information referring to any legal advice relating to the claimants .

            "comcast is abandoning its bid to buy time warner cable for $ 45.2 billion and create a mega-size tv and internet provider , it was reported today . the move comes after federal communications commission decided that merger was n't in the public interest and threw up a regulatory roadblock following fierce opposition from net neutrality activists and content providers like disney and 21st century fox . bloomberg , followed by the new york times , reported thursday afternoon that comcast is planning to ` walk away ' from the deal rather than fight it out with the federal government . an announcement from the telecoms giant , already the biggest cable company in the country , could come as early as tomorrow . comcast and time warner cable declined to comment on thursday . ding-dong : experts , including columbia university professor tim wu , declared the comcast-time warner cable murder dead after the fcc expressed skepticism mega-merger : the $ 45.2 billion deal would have merged comcast 's 30million customers with time warner cable 's 11million . the new company would have spun off or sold 3.9 million customers the proposed merger would have controlled 57percent of the broadband internet market and 30 percent of the paid tv market with more than 27million customers across the nation . on wednesday night , the wall street journal revealed that federal communications commission regulators questioned whether the creation of mega-size tv and internet provider was in the public interest . staffers reportedly planned to recommend that an administrative law judge review the deal - a regulatory obstacle that is likely to cost both companies several months of hearings and many millions of dollars . the hearings were likely to draw the companies past the merger deadline , at the very least . columbia university professor and net neutrality activist tim wu tweeted : ` comcast merger is dead . ' cnn 's brian stelter reports that some inside the companies were talking about the deal in the past tense almost immediately after the fcc decision . combining the no. 1 and no. 2 u.s. cable companies would put nearly 30 percent of tv and about 55 percent of broadband subscribers under one roof . that would give the resulting behemoth unprecedented power over what americans watch and download . that has had competitors , consumer groups , and senators lining up to oppose the deal . time warner cable 's shares dipped slightly in trading on thursday - though comcast stocks were actually up after the news ` this is one of those deals where the opponents of the merger have been one of the most vocal i can remember , ' said s&p capital iq tuna amobi . one concern , for example , is that the company could undermine the streaming video industry by requiring onerous payments from new online-only video providers for connecting to its network . dish , the satellite tv company behind the new web video service sling tv , and netflix are opposed to the deal . another charge is that comcast has n't stuck to conditions imposed on it when it bought nbcuniversal . the company says it has , except for one circumstance when the fcc found it was n't promoting a stand-alone internet service . comcast says it fixed that . pushback against the merger has picked up in the last couple weeks . al franken , d-minn. , along with five other democratic senators and bernie sanders , i-vermont , this week urged the federal communications commission and the department of justice to block the merger , saying it would lead to higher prices and fewer choices . recent media reports suggested that regulators are n't going to approve it . on friday , bloomberg , citing unidentified people , said department of justice staff attorneys were leaning against the deal . the wall street journal on wednesday said , also citing unidentified people , said that fcc staff recommended that the merger review go to a hearing under an administrative law judge , although no final decision had been made . the fcc would send the deal to a judge if it did n't believe it serves the public interest . the company has the right to present its case to the judge . but a trial could take months and even then a decision could be appealed to the fcc . ` it 's a dead end for comcast , ' said rob mcdowell , a former fcc commissioner . the justice department declined to comment . the fcc declined to comment and spokesman neil grace said the review is ongoing . comcast spokeswoman sena fitzmaurice confirmed that company executives met wednesday with justice department and fcc officials . but she would not comment on what occurred during the meetings or what other conversations the company is having with regulators . if the comcast-time warner cable deal falls through , a transaction with charter communications inc. aimed to smoothing the way for regulatory approval also falls apart . charter 's bid for bright house networks , which it announced in march , could also be killed . many analysts expect that charter , which lost out on its bid for time warner cable to comcast , to resurrect its effort if comcast is rebuffed . ` other cable deals that do n't involve comcast might be allowed to go through , ' mcdowell said . there ` seems to be an antipathy towards comcast at the fcc ' because the agency thinks comcast did n't stick to the conditions of the nbcuniversal merger , he said . a combined charter and time warner cable would have 15 million video customers and 16.5 million internet customers . that 's still smaller than comcast alone , which has 22.4 million video subscribers and 22 million internet customers . comcast wanted time warner cable to bulk up on subscribers as it deals with old rivals dish , directv and verizon 's fios , as well as newer , cheaper online competitors like netflix . the company had also said the deal would help it cut costs , including for programming -- the shows and movies it pipes to subscribers . but comcast may have to look overseas for future acquisitions . ` washington 's concern here is excessive control of broadband in the hands of a single company , ' wrote analyst craig moffett in a client email . ` for all intents and purposes , their m&a ambitions would be on ice in the u.s.

            "the baby , known as mary , had been born at alder hey hospital in liverpool , pictured , but died six months later with traces of cocaine in her stomach a six-month-old baby died with traces of cocaine in her stomach despite her drug-user parents being reported to social services five times . small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant , known as mary , who died suddenly in 2013 , after a lengthy stay in alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool . now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby 's vulnerability . according to a report , mary 's family , who lived in liverpool , were well-known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse , domestic violence and child neglect . a school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up . mary was the youngest child in a family of four children born to a mother aged 30 and a father aged 33 . at the time of her death , her siblings were one , eight and 10 . her parents came to the attention of social care unit careline five times between 2008 and 2012 . mary 's siblings ' school had already raised concerns that the two eldest children were overweight , staying off school and left to look after their baby brother while their parents stayed in bed . mary was born 12 weeks early at alder hey children 's hospital in january 2013 and was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions , including a heart murmur . she was kept in hospital for three months during which time there were ` several consecutive days ' in which she had no contact with her parents . after she was discharged from hospital and into her parents ' care , a number of community nurse follow-up visits were scheduled . but the nurse was unable to get access to the family despite visiting them three times in one week . a fourth visit was successful but later appointments were not kept . a day before mary died in july 2013 , a health visitor went to the home but was stopped at the door . a post-mortem revealed the presence ` at very low levels ' of cocaine , tramadol and mirtazapine ( an anti-depressant ) in her stomach . police also found empty beer cans , drugs and a syringe on the premises and her mother admitted to the police that she used cocaine and cannabis in the home . because of a lack of evidence , a coroner ruled the cause of mary 's death was ` unascertained ' as it was ruled the traces of drugs , which could have come from the environment or through resuscitation attempts , were not considered to have directly led to her death . a post-mortem revealed the presence of cocaine , pictured , at ` very low levels ' as well as tramadol and mirtazapine , an anti depressant ( file picture ) the report said : ` whilst agencies had some concerns about the older children , they generally worked to single rather than multi-agency agendas and processes . ` there was some evidence of good informal liaisons such as between the school and the education welfare officer , or the school and school nurse , but generally the level of inter-agency communication required to support a family with four children was not achieved . ` child mary was a vulnerable child and a discussion between health professionals may well have highlighted important information about [ the mother 's ] history of not engaging with health services in respect of her children and the shared information may have led to further action . ' but liverpool safeguarding children board , which compiled the independent report , said it was impossible to tell if the death of baby mary -- not her real name -- could have been avoided . chairman howard cooper said : ` predicting the likelihood of such an outcome for a vulnerable baby is difficult to achieve with any meaningful degree of accuracy . ` it can not be inferred that child mary 's death was preventable , but there are lessons to be learned for all the agencies involved with this family about multi-agency working . \" mr cooper said a number of recommendations had been made in the wake of the infant 's death to improve working relationships between agencies tasked with supporting vulnerable children and their families . the 10 findings made by the board included an assessment that the follow-up services by mary 's hospital and community health services were \" ineffective \" for a vulnerable baby in the care of parents with a \" very poor history of co-operation \" . the panel also criticised the lack of a multi-agency system for monitoring missed medical appointments , resulting in \" potentially significant \" signs of neglect being missed .\n",

            "tiny babies are more sensitive to pain than adults , according to a study of infants ' brains which overturns the medical consensus . until now doctors have assumed that the brains of very young babies are not developed enough to feel pain . it means that newborns often go without painkillers , even during invasive procedures . but the new findings , revealed by oxford university doctors , suggest that not only do babies feel pain , but their pain thresholds are even lower than those of adults . research on infants ' brains by doctors from oxford university has found that young babies are more sensitive to pain than adults . it overturns the medical consensus that newborns have a high pain threshold ( file picture ) in the first study of its kind , the researchers showed in brain scans that infants ' brains react in much the same way as adults when given even mild pain . dr rebeccah slater , of oxford 's department of paediatrics , said : ` obviously babies ca n't tell us about their experience of pain and it is difficult to infer pain from visual observations . ` in fact some people have argued that babies ' brains are not developed enough for them to really \" feel \" pain , any reaction being just a reflex -- our study provides the first really strong evidence that this is not the case . ' the results , published in the journal elife , suggest that it is possible to see pain ` happening ' inside the infant brain - and it looks a lot like pain in adults . up until the 1980s it was common practice for babies to go without pain relief during surgery - they were given neuromuscular blocks to stop them moving , but otherwise were given no pain medication . a landmark study in 1987 suggested for the first time that doctors may have been wrong in their assumptions , and anaesthetics were introduced for major operations . but injections are still given and intravenous drips still inserted without pain relief , and far more serious procedures carried out anything to take away the child 's pain . even this year , nhs guidelines are still being written that advise doctors to carry out seemingly painful procedures without anything more than ` a cuddle ' . guidelines for a procedure to treat tongue-tie - a common problem in which the bottom of an infant 's tongue is attached to the mouth - still suggest that no pain relief is needed . the research , which was carried out by doctors from oxford university ( pictured ) overturns the medical consensus that very young babies do not feel pain and do not need painkillers , even for invasive procedures the nhs guidelines , updated in january 2015 , advise that when the tongue is sliced from the mouth 's floor , infants do not need medication . older babies who have already teethed should be given a general anaesthetic , doctors are told . but the guidelines say : ` in small babies , being cuddled and fed is more important than painkillers . ' dr slater called for a review of the way tiny babies are treated . ` thousands of babies across the uk undergo painful procedures every day but there are often no local pain management guidelines to help clinicians , ' she said . ` our study suggests that not only do babies experience pain but they may be more sensitive to it than adults . ` we have to think that if we would provide pain relief for an older child undergoing a procedure then we should look at giving pain relief to an infant undergoing a similar procedure . ' her team scanned the brains of ten healthy infants aged between one and six days old , and compared them to the brains of ten adults aged 23 to 36 years . mri scans were taken of the babies ' brains as they were poked on the bottom of their feet with a special retracting rod creating a sensation like being poked with a pencil -- mild enough that it did not wake them up . the researchers found that 18 of the 20 pain regions in adults ' brains also ` lit up ' in babies ' brains . scans also showed that babies ' brains had the same response to a weak poke as adults did to a stimulus four times as strong - suggesting their pain thresholds are lower . dr slater said it is not clear which types of painkiller would be best used for babies . there are fears that local anaesthetics can be easily absorbed into the blood stream , with unknown consequences . ` finding the optimum pain relief for babies is clearly required , ' she said .\n",

            "benefits and welfare schemes are often blamed for making people less likely to want to work . but a study has found that the opposite may be true . a europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick , and invested in employment schemes , the more likely its residents were to want a job . a europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job . in norway , which pays the highest benefits in europe , almost 80 % of people wanted a job . in estonia , one of least generous , only around 40 % did in norway in particular , which pays the highest benefits in europe , almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job , by contrast in estonia , one of the least generous countries , only around 40 per cent did . the survey was carried out by sociologists dr kjetil van der wel and dr knut halvorsen from oslo and akershus university college . they examined responses to the statement : ' i would enjoy having a paid job even if i did not need the money ' put to the interviewees for the european social survey in 2010 . people who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor . the extraordinary results of a recent study from aarhus university found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues . researchers said people 's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but ` rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves . ' and they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance , with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology . these responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes , while taking into account the population differences between the member states . the uk was average for the generosity of benefits , which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent . the researchers also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they did n't need the money . ` many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion , disincentives to work and dependency cultures , ' the researchers said in the paper , ` the bigger the worse ? a comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment ' . ' a basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic , social and psychological - from living off public benefits , compared to being employed , they would prefer the former . the uk was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60 % ( stock image pictured ) . the study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they did n't need the money ` when a ` critical mass ' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work , the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken , setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the ` self-destruction ' of the welfare state . they also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work . ` the notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency , or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work , receives little support .

            "a second utah student has filed a lawsuit against the davis county school district for hiring an english teacher who then allegedly went on to have sex with him and two other boys . disgraced davis high school educator brianne altice , 35 , was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges , including rape , sodomy , sexual abuse and sex with a minor , in connection to her suspected affairs with three students . in mid-march , one of the alleged victims brought a $ 647,000 lawsuit against the utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the ` flirtatious ' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him . more legal trouble : two students have now filed lawsuits against the davis county school district in utah accusing officials of failing to fire english teacher brianne altice , pictured in court in january , who is accused of having six with three boys the latest lawsuit , filed last week , describes how altice began flirting with the student , then 16 , and other boys in her class , reported the salt lake tribune . court documents detail how at times , the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with altice , sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her . on her part , the 35-year-old altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems . according to the complaint , the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical . court documents state that altice 's dalliances were an open secret at davis high , where the running joke among students was : ` who is ms altice sleeping with now ? ' similarly to the first lawsuit , the new complaint alleges that the school district was aware of brianne altice 's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her . she allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on bail for charges relating to the first two students . her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars . not happy : altice is pictured in court in february after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied the student who brought the initial lawsuit in march accused the district of being negligent when it hired altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him . he claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex . he stated that the school district had reprimanded altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired , the tribune reported . school district spokesman chris williams said at the time he was unaware of the lawsuit . despite the claims against her , one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against altice are ` ridiculous ' and ` she does n't deserve to be here ' . in trouble : altice , pictured at a hearing in february 2014 , allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 he told the court he had sex with altice once prior to october 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in december , while she was out on bail . in august 2014 , a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former davis high english teacher , whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal . altice 's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students . ` it is her defense that they did not happen at all , ' he wrote in a motion . ` that she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students . ' but prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions . the teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of altice 's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body . one of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the english teacher , left , even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students . she was first taken into custody in 2013 brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial , arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in october 2013 to interview her . brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children , call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her . ` her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called miranda rights , ' brass wrote in court papers . ` the evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement . ' in february , she requested to drop one of the charges , claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys . but a judge denied the motion . altice would be tried separately in each student 's case -- meaning she 'll get three different trials .\n",

            "( cnn ) the arrest and death of freddie gray in baltimore has sparked protests and accusations of police brutality . but it 's unclear how gray , who was arrested on a weapons charge april 12 , suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later . here are the big questions surrounding this controversial case : what we know : gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of baltimore known for drugs . he \" gave up without the use of force , \" baltimore deputy police commissioner jerry rodriguez said last week . an officer apparently took his taser out and was prepared to use it on gray , but he never deployed it , rodriguez said . and none of the six officers involved in the arrest described using force against the 25-year-old . gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk , said rodriguez , who described gray as upset . \" and when mr. gray was taken out of that van , he could not talk , and he could not breathe , \" according to rodriguez . police have said gray was not buckled in with a seat belt during the ride to a booking center . what we do n't know : it 's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest , and it 's also unknown what , if anything , happened inside the van . what we know : segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after gray has been arrested and show officers dragging gray , who is handcuffed , to a van . he can be heard screaming . \" he was dragged a bit , \" said baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake , \" but then you see him using his legs to get into the van , so he was able-bodied when he was in the van . and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van , he was unresponsive . \" one woman who recorded a video of the arrest said she knew gray . \" when i ran up the street and seen him , the first thing i asked him was he ok because i heard him screaming , \" the woman said . \" he did n't never say yes or no , he just said ' i ca n't breathe ' and just was yelling . \" surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking , police said . that was at 8:54 a.m. . at 9:24 a.m. , police called an ambulance for gray . police say gray requested medical attention , including an inhaler , and an ambulance later took him to the university of maryland medical center 's shock trauma center . rawlings-blake and deputy police commissioner kevin davis have said the arresting officers should have asked for medical attention immediately after gray asked for it . what we do n't know : it 's unknown why gray screamed , and the cell phone video does n't capture the entire incident , start to end . and it 's unclear why police did n't call for an ambulance sooner . what we know : in the wake of gray 's death , six police officers were suspended . their names were released last week . the suspensions are standard procedure after an \" in-custody death , \" said baltimore police department spokesman capt. eric kowalczyk . it does n't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved , he said . they are : lt. brian rice , 41 , who joined the department in 1997 ; officer caesar goodson , 45 , who joined in 1999 ; sgt. alicia white , 30 , who joined in 2010 ; officer william porter , 25 , who joined in 2012 ; officer garrett miller , 26 , who joined in 2012 ; and officer edward nero , 29 , who joined in 2012 . three of the six responding officers were on bicycles when they initially approached gray , according to kowalczyk . another officer joined the arrest after it was initiated , while one more drove the police van , the police spokesman said . what we do n't know : the officers say they did n't use force against gray , but that 's not certain . in fact , details about what each of the officers specifically did have not been released . what we know : according to court documents cnn obtained , there were more than 20 criminal court cases in maryland against gray , and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death . the cases involve mostly drug-related charges , but there are charges from march for second-degree assault and destruction of property . gray was due in court on a possession charge on april 24 . he had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases , according to maryland department of corrections spokesman gerard shields . in february 2009 , he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver . shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved . gray was paroled on june 30 , 2011 . on april 4 , 2012 , gray was arrested for violating parole but he did n't go back to prison , shields said , reasoning that whatever gray allegedly did , it \" was something minor . \" gray did return to prison in may 2013 for drug possession , serving a month behind bars before his release in june . what we do n't know : it 's not known whether gray 's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest , or his death . what we know : protesters have taken to the streets of baltimore daily since two days after gray 's death , rallying around his family . on the first night , they marched to a local police station chanting \" no justice ! on another occasion they marched to city hall . the demonstrations have been peaceful on most nights , but on monday rioters damaged buildings and destroyed police vehicles . looters stole goods from several stores . some groups of people intervened , keeping additional looters out of trashed businesses . the demonstrators are pushing to get answers about gray 's death and for \" justice , \" as they define it . similar protests were held in ferguson , missouri , following michael brown 's death and in new york , after the death of eric garner . other small protests have sprung up in other cities in the past week . \" mr. gray 's family deserves justice , \" rawlings-blake told cnn 's anderson cooper last week . \" and our community deserves an opportunity to heal , to get better , and to make sure that something like this does n't happen again . the mayor said that any confirmed information will be promptly relayed to the public . \" i want people to understand that i have no interest in hiding information , holding back information , \" rawlings-blake said . some protesters have called for the officers to be arrested and charged . one organizer called for police commissioner anthony batts to resign . what we do n't know : there 's no guarantee protesters will get the kind of definitive answers they want about how and why gray died . what we know : baltimore police are looking into gray 's death and are expected to have a report for prosecutors by friday . the probe , like the suspensions of the six police officers , is standard whenever someone dies while in custody . the police 's findings will go to the state 's attorney 's office , where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed . batts said recently that a medical examiner had some initial findings , but needed to get back the results of toxicology reports , which could take weeks . rawlings-blake asked for an outside investigation , given the city 's dark history of police misconduct . the u.s. justice department , which announced a collaborative reform initiative with baltimore police in october in light of its past problems , is looking into the gray case , a spokesman said last week . the point of that federal investigation will be to gauge whether a prosecutable civil rights violation may have occurred . what we do n't know : what information that investigators , both local and federal , will turn

            "magistrates at rotherham magistrates court took just 15 minutes to find ms gaynor not guilty a mother-of-two was locked in a police cells for six hours and put on bail for seven months before being put on trial for chopping back tree branches hanging over her garden . karen gaynor appeared at rotherham magistrates court accused of causing criminal damage by pruning the tree , after a complaint was made by her next door neighbour kay daye , as part of a long-running boundary dispute . but magistrates took just 15 minutes to find the 53-year-old not guilty , saying that she had acted with good intentions . the court heard how council officials had told ms gaynor that she could trim the tree near her home in rotherham but physically refused to show her how much . however , the prosecution then told of how her pruning of the tree ` went way beyond the lawful excuse ' and caused ` unnecessary damage ' . adam walker , prosecuting , said that any trimming of a tree belonging to someone else could be criminal damage and that ms gaynor had lawful excuse , which she had exceeded . he said : ` in july 2014 , alan hepinstall , a council mediator , visited ms gaynor 's home . ` mr hepinstall told ms gaynor she could cut overhanging branches back vertically and in line with the boundary but did not show the defendant what he meant . ` there remains one disputed issue of fact and that 's the state of the tree before it was pruned . ' neighbour mrs daye then told the court that before the tree had been cut last september , it was in a good condition but after she pruned it , ` it was terrible , all chopped back and dead . ' however , helen shepherd , mitigating , said the conifer had already been dying in the middle which had created a gap but the top of the tree was healthy . ms gaynor confirmed to the court that she had a 90-minute meeting with three council officials at her home last july . she said she asked mr hepinstall to demonstrate how to cut the branches as she ` did n't want to get in any trouble . ' her daughter , hayley , also told the court mr hepinstall refused to show them because he ` did not have the time . ' ms gaynor went voluntarily to main street police station in rotherham following the complaint of criminal damage but said she had been reassured she would not be arrested . she added : ' i did n't have a solicitor with me so i feel i was coaxed in . ' i went into the interview and the police read me my rights . i told them i could not understand what ` rights ' meant . ` then the officer slammed his book shut and said : ` right , i am now going to arrest you ' . ` for all the scandal in rotherham at the moment to think that the police and council have time , money and resources to waste on such a silly thing as a tree is disgusting . ' mr and mrs daye have refused to comment on the case . michael quinn , a senior district prosecutor with the crown prosecution service , yorkshire and humberside , said the incident followed an acrimonious eight-year long neighbour dispute . karen gaynor , next to the hedge that she pruned , that ended up with her being locked in a police cell for six hours , put on bail for seven months and being put on trial for criminal damage ms gaynor 's neighbour michael daye . a complaint was made about the hedge as part of a long-running boundary dispute he said : ` the allegation was that the damage to the tree went well beyond pruning and that it had been hacked back to little more than a stump . ' a caution was not available as no admissions to the offending were made and so the police took the decision to charge the suspect . ` we respect the decision of the magistrates ' court and note that it made no criticism of our case . ' under common law , you can cut back a branch from a tree that overhangs or encroaches on your property . the conifer hedge in this case formed the border between the gardens of karen gaynor and her next door neighbours . at dispute was whether she had cut back too much of the hedge . the law allows a householder to carry out limited pruning from their own side . however they are not allowed to trespass on their neighbour 's property or alter the height of trees and hedges . the work must be carried out carefully to avoid damage or cause the tree to be unsafe . the prosecution was brought under a charge of criminal damage . this may have been because prosecutors considered the damage caused to the hedge was intentional and related to a neighbour dispute . rotherham council 's housing and estate services manager paul walsh said the matter of the ` boundary hedge ' would normally have been discussed between neighbours but the ongoing dispute made this impossible . he said : ` ms gaynor was provided with appropriate advice about what she could reasonably and legitimately do . ` clear and concise instructions were given and the officers did not leave until they were satisfied that those instructions were understood . ms gaynor was also advised to act reasonably . ' michael quinn , a senior district prosecutor with the crown prosecution service , yorkshire and humberside , said the incident over the hedge , pictured , followed an acrimonious eight-year long neighbour dispute the hedge in between ms gaynor and mrs day 's homes . ms gaynor went voluntarily to main street police station in rotherham following the complaint of criminal damage he said the decision to prosecute was made by the police and cps . while a south yorkshire police spokeswoman said the council had provided them with a statement that demonstrated that permission was not granted for the tree to be cut . she added : ` police received complaints about criminal damage that the complainants felt had been caused intentionally . ' a thorough investigation was conducted that resulted in a woman being charged and brought before the courts . '\n",

' their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other . \" on friday night , scott 's open casket was draped with an american flag , and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in charleston . a dallas cowboys banner -- his favorite nfl team -- was placed outside the casket , and a figurine of a cowboys player stood at his side . but scott 's family was missing . they needed privacy , said charleston mayor joseph riley , who attended . a week ago , scott was killed in north charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight . a passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video , and officer michael slager was swiftly charged with murder . he was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted . the video shows scott running from an officer , who fires eight shots . scott is struck five times ; he falls to the ground . \" nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer 's life or the life of another was threatened , \" national urban league president marc morial said . \" the question here is whether the use of force was excessive . \" but one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting . and at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up . on thursday , gwen nichols told cnn 's brian todd that she saw scott and slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot . \" it was like a tussle type of thing , like , you know , like , ` what do you want ? ' or ` what did i do ? ' type of thing , \" nichols said . \" i did n't hear mr. slager saying ` stop ! ' \" nichols ' account has similarities to slager 's . he had told investigators that he had tussled with scott over his taser and that he feared for his safety . criminal defense attorney paul callan said he believes slager 's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case . \" defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- ( that ) this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation , a physical altercation with a suspect , \" callan said . \" and that would constitute manslaughter under law , as opposed to murder , and it makes a huge difference in sentencing . \" in south carolina , a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation . but the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video , feidin santana , paints a different picture . he was walking to work when he saw slager on top of scott , he said , who was on the ground . santana said he could hear the sound of a taser in use . he said he did n't see scott go after the taser , as slager initially claimed . he said he believes scott was trying to get away . \" mr. scott never tried to fight , \" santana said . neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video , because santana started recording shortly after that . investigators from the south carolina law enforcement division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start , it said in a statement . \" we believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter , \" division chief mark keel said in a statement . \" the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions . \" slager 's lawyer , andy savage , has complained that he \" has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has . \" savage 's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive \" any investigative documents , audio or video tapes , other than a copy of mr. slager 's arrest warrant . \" the news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that slager belongs to \" is no longer involved in the case . \" charleston county sheriff al cannon said slager 's wife , jamie , who is eight months ' pregnant , and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center friday . slager was being held in isolation and being \" monitored for his mental health , \" cannon said . in a statement , one of slager 's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour . \" his wife and mom were tearful but strong , and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person , even if separated by a thick pane of glass , \" the statement said . \" they held up family photos -- and even jamie 's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him . throughout the visit , michael was focused on jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families . \" a second video , taken from a police dash cam , has also emerged from the day scott died . it shows moments before the shooting , when things seemed to be going smoothly between scott and slager . scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle , and slager returns to his car to do paperwork . then scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera 's frame . scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $ 18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop , according to court records . that was why he ran , lawyers for the family said after the funeral service . u.s. rep. james clyburn , d-south carolina , told reporters outside the service that scott lost a $ 35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support . \" he said it was the best job he 's ever had , \" clyburn said . \" now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support , there 's got to be income . and you ai n't going to make much income from jail . it seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom . \" on friday afternoon , police met with a man who was in scott 's car , but the passenger 's name was n't in a police report obtained by cnn . he was detained briefly after the shooting , one officer wrote in the report . scott family attorney chris stewart said he was a co-worker and friend . but he did not identify the passenger by name . on friday , a few mourners trickled into the fielding home for funerals . a white banner with a blue star near scott 's casket displayed his favorite nfl team . it said : \" tradition , the cowboys way . \" \" this is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community , \" said riley , the mayor . \" it breaks everyone 's hearts . \" cnn 's polo sandoval and martin savidge reported from charleston , and ben brumfield and ray sanchez reported and wrote in atlanta and new york .\n",

' it is not hard to see why player would have such a special affinity for mcilroy . two men of similar stature who came from a foreign land to take on the americans in the majors in their own backyard ; two men with a commitment to fitness with minds strong enough to ward off all the criticism . it was player , of course , who wrote the book when it came to golfers and fitness . heavens , he is still doing 1,300 sit-ups and squatting 300lb every morning even now , at the age of 79 . he is withering in his contempt of those who say mcilroy is ` bulking up ' too much in the gym . ` i 'm going to guess most of the critics are fat and do n't watch what they eat , ' he says . ` just because they 're lazy , they ca n't grasp that fitness is so vital . tom watson presents player with a green jacket after the 1978 masters tournament at augusta national ` i was told that because i was so keen on fitness my career in golf would be over early and i would n't win any tournaments after the age of 34 . i was told i had no chance of winning the us open if i was squatting 325lb the previous evening . ` i 'm just so pleased to see travelling gymnasiums on the circuit and that most players see the value of putting themselves through the pain barrier . i used to go down to the local ymca wherever we were playing and sometimes wait 20 minutes to use the equipment . but it you want to be a superstar , and by a superstar i mean a player who has won at least six majors , there are no short cuts . woods could pose a threat to mcilroy at the masters after confirming that he will play at augusta ` rory will be an absolute superstar when he wins the masters . and yes , i can see a lot of similarities with myself . i love the fact he is a people person , for example , and engages with the fans . that 's what i used to love , and still do . so many pros ca n't be bothered to talk to the fans and it 's so wrong . ' player also gives short shrift to the idea that completing the career grand slam is a modern media invention . ` i tell you it was electrifying when i completed it in 1965 , ' he said . ` i so wanted to follow gene sarazen and particularly ben hogan and become the third player to achieve it , because hogan was the best player i 'd seen . jack and i were both in competition to complete it and it was a piece of advice jack gave me that helped me over the line . ` i was due to play a tournament at greensboro in 1965 when jack said if i wanted to win the us open and complete the set i should go with him to the us open site and practise . i said i needed the money , that i had loads of children to look after , but i went with him . so he played a key role . mcilroy manages a smile after throwing away a four-shot lead on the final day of the masters in 2011 jack nicklaus waves before hitting his drive at the ceremonial start of the 2014 masters golf tournament ` it was amazing afterwards . everyone wanted to know how a man from a small country who lost his mother at the age of eight and his dad worked in a mine could achieve such a thing . how on earth could it happen ? ' player and nicklaus have remained lifelong friends . they will be partners in a team competition in the autumn before player heads to greece for his 80th birthday celebrations . ` there will be 35 people there and jack and i will need to win that event for me to be able to pay for it , ' said player , laughing . as for augusta , he is looking forward as ever to hitting the ceremonial first shot on thursday alongside nicklaus and arnold palmer . and then , 50 years on from his own date with history , he will join every other fascinated observer to see if another non-american can complete the set of majors and join him on what former us open champion curtis strange evocatively refers to as golf 's mount rushmore .\n",

deaths of two new york city police officers who were ambushed in brooklyn . the shootings demonstrated how easy it is to kill a cop , she said . \" killing a police officer is easier than buying food , \" she is quoted as saying in the complaint , \" because sometimes one has to wait in line to buy food . \" when the undercover agent later pointed out that more than 25,000 officers had gathered for the funeral of one of the cops , officer rafael ramos , velentzas complimented the agent for \" coming up with an attractive potential target \" for a terror attack , the complaint said . velentzas and siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad , the complaint said . they praised successful and unsuccessful terror attempts against americans . \" as alleged , the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland , \" loretta lynch , u.s. attorney for the eastern district of new york , said in a statement . \" we remain firm in our resolve to hold accountable anyone who would seek to terrorize the american people , whether by traveling abroad to commit attacks overseas or by plotting here at home . \" in 2009 , siddiqui wrote a poem in a magazine published by al qaeda in the arabian peninsula that urged readers to wage jihad . she declared there is no \" excuse to sit back and wait -- for the skies rain martyrdom . \" prosecutors said the women \" researched and acquired \" components for a car bomb such as the one used in the 1993 world trade center bombing , a fertilizer bomb such as the one used in the 1995 bombing of the federal building in oklahoma city and a pressure cooker device such as the one used in the 2013 boston marathon bombing . velentzas described the late al qaeda founder osama bin laden as one of her heroes . she kept a photo of bin laden holding an ak-47 as the background image on her cellphone , the complaint said . there were more opportunities of \" pleasing allah \" by engaging in jihad on american soil , she said . in february , velentzas and the undercover agent drove past a home depot in queens . velentzas laughed about once having told a home depot employee that she was having a barbecue when she was looking for propane . \" some women like to look at clothes , \" the complaint quotes her as saying . \" i like to look at electric equipment . \" in a statement , islamic circle of north america said velentzas was formerly homeless and provided shelter by the relief organization . \" she stayed for a short period of time between 2008 and 2009 , \" the statement said . \" while she was staying in our shelter , our staff helped her get on her feet . during this time she successfully completed studies to become a home health care provider after which she became gainfully employed . she left the facility when she married . \" velentzas appeared to have experienced hardship in her life but was \" working towards self-development and long-term stability , \" the statement said . \" she also appeared to be someone who had greatly benefited from the assistance icna relief provides through our shelter system , so we asked her to speak about the experience of our shelter . she appeared at several fundraisers and was the subject of videos as well . \" ashley chung , a neighbor in queens , said velentzas had a young daughter and lived with her husband . \" she 's a very friendly woman and i would never even expect that at all , \" chung said when asked about the allegations . \" they 're very lovely people . ... it 's so crazy how you live next to someone and you have no idea what they 're up to . \" thursday 's arrests are part of a series of cases being built by the federal government . last month , an army national guard member and his cousin were arrested in illinois and accused of conspiring to provide material support to isis , federal prosecutors said . the alleged plot included a plan to attack a u.s. military installation in illinois . spc. hasan edmonds , 22 , was arrested last week at chicago midway international airport while attempting to travel to egypt to eventually join isis , according to assistant attorney general for national security john p. carlin and other federal officials . his cousin , jonas \" yunus \" edmonds , 29 , was arrested at his home in aurora , illinois , in connection with an alleged plot to carry out an armed attack on an unspecified u.s. military facility in northern illinois where hasan edmonds had been training . the two u.s. citizens were charged in criminal complaints filed in u.s. district court of the northern district of illinois with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization . in february , three new york men were arrested and accused of a failed attempt to join isis in syria , prosecutors said . abror habibov , 30 , who operated kiosks at malls along the east coast , was

            "snp leader nicola sturgeon today hit back at claims from tory former prime minister sir john major that she poses a ` real and present danger ' to the uk . in a speech today , sir john claimed the snp would use any power they wield in westminster after the election to foster division and further their dream of the break up of the 300-year-old union . and he mocked ms sturgeon over her demand to play a role in propping up a labour government , when she is ` not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself . snp leader nicola sturgeon was mocked by ex-pm sir john major over her demand to play a role in proper up a labour government , when she is ` not even bothering ' to stand as an mp herself sir john said that he had repeatedly warned in the 1990s that devolution to scotland would make independence more , not less , likely . labour had argued it would ` kill independence stone dead ' but instead it ` fanned the flame ' which lead to the referendum which left the union ` battered ' but intact . ` now , it is at risk again , ' he said . labour 's only route back to power is in hock to smaller , left wing parties , he said , leading to ` more borrowing , more spending , an end to welfare reform , and far more people dragged into higher tax brackets ' . welsh nationalists plaid cymru would demand more money for wales while the ` worthy ' green party 's economic plan is ' a recipe for economic self-harm ' . he warned of ` mayhem ' if the snp holds the balance of power , with a weak labour government open to a ` daily dose of blackmail ' to secure the support of the nationalists in commons votes . the snp would use its role in westminster to bolster support ahead of next year 's scottish parliament elections , when it will put independence back on the agenda , sir john said . the tories hope to capitalise on a damning poll which shows more than half of british voters want ms sturgeon and her party to play no part in the next government . ` the snp is a real and present danger to our future , ' sir john said . ` they will pit scotland against england . that could be disastrous to the people of scotland -- and fatal to the uk as a whole . ' but ms sturgeon branded his comments ` an affront to democracy ' . addressing the scottish trades union congress in ayr , she said that snp mps at westminster could ` vigorously and loudly ' support a future labour government in some areas . the snp leader added : ` john major 's comments are silly , over the top and frankly they do n't show him in a particularly good light . ' i want the snp to go to westminster to make scotland 's voice heard and also to be a voice for better politics , for the kind of politics that stands in opposition to tory policies of austerity and undermining public services and pushing more people into poverty . ' i can understand why that message of standing up for ordinary people not just in scotland but across the uk might offend john major as an ex-tory prime minister , but i think it 's a message that will continue to win support right across scotland . ' the former prime minister sought to contrast the ` social division ' he said was sown up labour 's politics with the economic competence and ` strongly beating heart ' he said typifies the tories nicola sturgeon is threatening to break up the uk without even ` bothering ' to stand for election to westminster , sir john major said today . in a personal attack on the snp leader , sir john cast doubt on the legitimacy of a party which only stands in one part of the country setting the direction of the national government . ` they are part of the united kingdom and so of course they have got the right to have a degree of legitimacy , ' he said . but he accused ms sturgeon of plotting the break-up of the union from edinburgh . ` what i 'm saying is i do n't think the snp party , whose leader is not even bothering to run for the westminster election , are behaving in a way that is in the interest of the united kingdom , by seeking policies that will break scotland away from the united kingdom . ` and they emphatically will not deny that separatism is their aim . ' after last year 's vote saw 55 per cent of scots reject the idea of separation , nationalists insisted the issue was settled for a generation . but ms sturgeon has since left the door open to a second referendum before 2020 . sir john said the snp would ` manufacture grievance ' to make a yes vote more likely any future referendum . ` they will ask for the impossible and create merry hell if it is denied . the nightmare of a broken united kingdom has not gone away . ` the separation debate is not over . the snp is determined to prise apart the united kingdom . ' ms sturgeon yesterday unveiled an anti-austerity manifesto setting out her price for propping up a weak labour government , including higher spending fuelled by more borrowing . polls continue to show up to half of scots are planning to back the snp , robbing labour of dozens of seats and depriving mr miliband of hopes of a majority . mr miliband and ms sturgeon have ruled out a formal coalition with snp mps sitting in cabinet . but they have left open the possibility of the snp supporting a labour government on a vote-by-vote basis , raising the prospect of mr miliband being forced to bow to their demands to get any legislation through . sir john warned that this will leave the country open to a ` daily dose of blackmail ' as the snp makes fresh demands in return for supporting labour in commons votes . ` if labour were to accept an offer of support from the snp , it could put the country on course to a government held to ransom on a vote-by-vote basis , ' sir john said . ` labour would be in hock to a party that - slowly but surely - will push them ever further to the left . and who would pay the price for this ? we would all pay for the snp 's ransom in our daily lives - through higher taxes , fewer jobs , and more and more debt . ` this is a recipe for mayhem . at the very moment our country needs a strong and stable government , we risk a weak and unstable one - pushed to the left by its allies , and open to a daily dose of political blackmail . ' and labour 's alistair darling , who led the no campaign against scottish independence , said the tories were ` flirting with english nationalism ' in a ` desperate ' way which could lead to another period of divisive wrangling over scotland 's position . labour leader ed miliband accused the conservatives and david cameron of ` talking up ' the snp in the hope that the nationalists will win seats from labour north of the border and allow him to ` crawl back ' into 10 downing street . a poll showed just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government , with 54 per cent opposed the snp has already suggested that it will be ` entitled to vote against any bit of legislation ' and ` any bit of spending ' it does not agree with . it means that for labour to pass new laws or agree to spending in england , wales or northern ireland they would have to strike a deal with the snp . much of the snp manifesto appeared designed to demonstrate common ground with labour , promising to scrap the bedroom tax , reverse nhs reforms , increase the minimum wage and tackle energy bills . but in key areas it went much further , threatening to drag labour further to the left to make the party ` bolder and better ' . it included scrapping the trident nuclear deterrent , ending austerity and embarking on a # 140billion spending spree . in a series of co-ordinated conservative attacks , david cameron warned a labour-snp deal would be a ` match made in hell ' for the british economy . london mayor boris johnson said allowing scottish nationalists to preside of the uk government would be like getting ` herod to run a baby farm ' . but some tories fear the attacks could backfire . lord forsyth - who served as scottish secretary in sir john 's government - warned that building up the snp to undermine support for labour in england could ultimately damage the union . ` we 've had the dilemma for conservatives , which is they want to be the largest party at westminster and therefore some see the fact that the nationalists are going to take seats in scotland will be helpful , ' he told the guardian . ` but that is a short-term and dangerous view which threatens the integrity of our country . ' ms sturgeon has made clear that in the event of a hung parliament she will be in london on may 8 to take charge of talks with labour . ' i am the leader of the party , i would lead those discussions if we 're in that scenario . ' however , just 22 per cent of voters across the uk back the idea of ms sturgeon playing a role in the uk government , with 54 per cent opposed . it makes the snp by far the least popular potential coalition partner . pollsters comres said older british adults were the most likely to be opposed to snp influence . a survey for itv news found an astonishing 71 per cent of those aged 65 and over want to lock ms sturgeon out of power , compared to 44 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds . amid fears of a backlash south of the border , ms sturgeon claimed she was offering the ` genuine hand of friendship ' to the rest of the uk . she said : ` the snp is n't going to westminster to seek to bring down governments or block budgets . we 're going to westminster to build an alliance for good , positive , progressive , sensible change .

' it was also in edmonton that paula made a public stand against drugs cheats holding up a banner saying ` epo cheats out ' . she 's remained a staunch anti-drugs campaigner throughout her career and has called for tougher testing measures . despite this , she 's also had to face accusations that she could n't have achieved her marathon world record clean - as it 's a time that has n't been surpassed in 12 years . she said earlier this year she finds such unfounded accusations ` horrible ' . ' i get it all the time . people saying \" she could n't have run 2.15 clean \" but i know i can be totally proud , ' she said . in 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in london in 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k but at the 2004 athens olympics , she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win paula was devastated she could n't finish the olympic marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand the athlete felt she 'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference ` it makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes . there will be some russians athletes who are not cheating , there are a lot of kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together . it spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport . ' paula bounced back from the disappointment in edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain . she won the world cross country championships and the london marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the commonwealth games and then the european championships . she bounced back from the olympic disappointment to take victory at the london marathon again in 2005 but the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route she also won a gold medal at the world champs in 2005 over the marathon distance her popularity soared as she was awarded an mbe in june 2002 and later that year was voted the bbc 's sports personality of the year . in 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight . she also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year . as a result , in 2004 she went into the athens olympics marathon as the firm favourite and hopes were high that she would finally win the gold olympic medal she deserved . but it was not to be . in training before the race , an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication . the medicine depleted her system but she was determined to still race . however , her weakened body could not take the pace and she was forced to drop out of the race in tears . she later said the time that followed was ` traumatic ' as she felt like she 'd let the nation down and gary admitted in itv4 's sports life stories that the media attention almost led to him having ' a nervous breakdown ' . the following year her success winning the london marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road . at the press conference afterwards , paula laughed off the embarrassing incident explaining her need for the toilet was giving her stomach cramps and ` the main thing was to win the race ' . later that year , she won another gold medal in the world championships over the marathon distance . paula and gary moved to monaco and started a family as daughter isla was born in january 2007 . less than a year later , paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the new york marathon . daughter isla was born in 2007 and months later , paula won the new york marathon but in 2008 , she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the beijing olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up . she 's pictured here being consoled by friend and fellow gb runner liz yelling son raphael was born in 2010 but injury again ruined her attempts to resume her running career once again she became an inspiration and proved to other elite female athletes that you can combine motherhood with a successful running career . in 2008 , paula lined up at the olympics again but injury in the build-up to the race meant she missed vital training and she was n't fit enough to compete with the best on the day . she finished in 23rd place and was once again upset she could n't fulfill her potential at the olympics . later that year she won the new york marathon and then took another career break to have son raphael . since then , she returned to competitive running but was often thwarted by injury causing her to pull out of major competitions . in 2012 , paula had surgery on a long-standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again the surgery worked and paula will now return to run the streets of london this weekend the athlete said she 's delighted to be back in the capital and sunday 's race will be ` really special ' a foot problem meant running in the london 2012 olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again . she kept up her interest in athletics becoming a commentator for the bbc and supporting grassroots running . following surgery in 2012 , she was relieved to be able to run again and is delighted she can now run the london marathon again , albeit not at full fitness . she said of sunday 's race : ' i know i am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special .

' neighbours said dr azeez then moved away in september after splitting up with his wife -- who is also a doctor -- and selling his house in tunbridge wells . he had attended school and completed his medical training in lahore , pakistan , before coming to britain . the father of two is also currently suspended from the general medical council 's register of doctors . tragedy : frances cappuccini , 30 , died from a haemorrhage hours after giving birth to her second son giacomo on october 9 , 2012 . two doctors have been charged with manslaughter by gross negligence heartbreak : lawyers said mrs cappuccini and her husband tom , 33 , from west malling , kent had decided on birth by planned caesarean - but were allegedly persuaded to try a natural birth instead a spokesman for kent police said : ` an international warrant has been issued for the arrest of dr azeez , who is believed to have left the country and returned to pakistan .

            "( cnn ) on thursday , president barack obama revealed that a u.s. drone strike had killed warren weinstein and giovanni lo porto , two aid workers held hostage on the afghanistan-pakistan border . al qaeda had sought to trade the two for prisoners held by the united states and an end to drone strikes . but it is not only terrorist groups that try to reap reward from the taking of hostages -- take the case of jason rezaian , the washington post 's tehran bureau chief . on april 20 , just two days before diplomats resumed talks in vienna , austria , to reach a final agreement over iran 's nuclear program , rezaian 's iranian attorney announced that his client had been charged with espionage , conducting propaganda , collaborating with foreign governments and collecting information \" with malicious intent . \" the state department , rezaian 's employers at the washington post and fellow journalists reacted with outrage . their anger is justified , but the decision should surprise no one : there is a long history of rogue regimes seizing hostages against the backdrop of diplomacy to extract concessions , humiliate the united states or signal unease . the scale of iran 's current hostage-taking -- not only rezaian but also iranian-americans saeed abedini and amir hekmati -- may pale in comparison with iranian behavior of decades past . but the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern . consider the original iran hostage seizure : on november 4 , 1979 , radical students seized the american embassy in tehran , ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days . often forgotten was what sparked that episode , which occurred more than nine months after ayatollah ruhollah khomeini declared the islamic revolution victorious . the problem was a rush to reconcile : at a november 1 , 1979 , algiers reception , zbigniew brzezinski , president jimmy carter 's national security adviser , met iranian prime minister mehdi bazargan . according to brzezinski 's own memoir , he told bazargan that the united states was open to any relationship the islamic republic wanted . photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world . iranian hardliners , meanwhile , were apoplectic that barzagan was \" betraying \" iran 's revolutionary principles , and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement . \" our young people must foil these plots , \" he reportedly said . the hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands . brzezinski 's dream of reconciliation became a nightmare . iran released the embassy hostages as ronald reagan took his oath of office , ending its first but not last hostage-taking episode . iranian proxies seized a number of americans in lebanon . reagan blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages . putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the nicaraguan contras , the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also , much as with obama 's outreach today , to solidify the moderate camp within the iranian political spectrum . initially , the scheme worked , but no sooner had american officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free , then kidnappers seized three more americans . hostage-taking had simply become another way to collect concessions . of course , iran is not alone in such games . whenever the united states tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold , it faces hostage crises . take north korea : obama campaigned as the anti-bush on the world stage . \" the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous , \" obama , then a senator , declared in july 2007 . obama had n't even marked two months in office when north korea detained two journalists working for al gore 's current tv . a kangaroo court sentenced laura ling and euna lee to 12 years in prison . it was traditional hostage diplomacy . former president bill clinton traveled to pyongyang to appeal for their release . north korean leader kim jong il used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor , kim jong un . north korea 's police force put out word that \" general kim jong un 's artifice let former u.s. president clinton cross the pacific to apologize to the great leader . it was all made possible thanks to general kim jong un 's extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics . \" north korea 's deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance . ling and lee were neither the first nor the last americans that north korea seized during the obama era . after north korea torpedoed a south korean ship , killing 46 , obama sought north korea 's censure in the u.n. security council . pyongyang responded by threatening aijalon mahli gomes , an american imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering north korea . on cue , former president jimmy carter arrived to mediate for gomes ' release , called for new talks and , by omission , derailed efforts to hold north korea accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen south korean sailors . the pattern would repeat in 2012 when north korea seized kenneth bae , an american whom kim jong un sought to leverage into concessions . the following year , north korea arrested an 85-year-old korean war veteran touring the hermit kingdom and , the next year , took two other tourists hostage . each arrest resulted in a high-level visit , an apology to north korea that bolstered the dear leader 's claims of strength and renewed engagement . saddam hussein likewise worked from the same playbook . in march 1995 , iraqi security forces seized two american defense contractors who strayed into iraq from kuwait . sentenced to eight years , they served 114 days before rep. bill richardson , d-new mexico , a close clinton ally ( and future cabinet-level u.n. ambassador ) flew to baghdad to retrieve them . the american media lauded richardson , but his trip was not without cost : saddam used it to depict iraq as strong and america as weak . \" president saddam hussein ... accepts the pleas by bill clinton , the congress and american people , \" the iraqi news agency reported . and so did the taliban . fifteen years before obama traded alleged american deserter bowe bergdahl for five high-value taliban and alleged al qaeda operatives imprisoned at guantanamo bay , the taliban arrested two americans female missionaries . their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of clinton-era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the taliban ; the taliban , too , knew how holding americans captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions . so what does iran 's hostage brinkmanship portend ? diplomats drink their own kool-aid , and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold . ego , ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries . hostages such as rezaian are canaries in the coal mine , however . their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy .\n",

            "rangers boss stuart mccall has delivered a sharp rebuke to david templeton after the winger criticised the training-ground methods deployed by the manager 's predecessors , ally mccoist and kenny mcdowall . former hearts star templeton claimed last week that mccall had introduced a brand of coaching and tactical preparation which had been lacking under the previous management . but mccall , who is busy transforming the club on the pitch after three successive wins in the championship , was less than impressed by the player 's comments and hinted that they may have been motivated by the player 's lack of game time under mccoist and mcdowall . rangers winger david templeton spoke out about his former managers ally mccoist and kenny mcdowall ` david made an error , ' said the ex-rangers midfielder . ` he was out of the frame a wee bit under kenny and ally . ` but he knows we are not here to criticise what went on before , because the players were part of that . all we are concentrating on is the here and now . ' mccall also had words of warning for skipper lee mcculloch , claiming his red card against hearts could cost him his place in the ibrox line-up . the defender has been given a two-match ban - starting with queen of the south at palmerston on thursday - after being sent off on sunday . the light blues captain put his elbow into the face of jambos striker osman sow as the pair jumped for a high ball . mccall , whose team clung on for a vital 2-1 win after playing 50 minutes a man down , had been happy with mcculloch 's displays until that point . but the interim rangers manager has now warned the former scotland cap he is not ` undroppable ' . he said : ` lee made a poor decision . i understand why he did it but it was a blatant red card . he led with his elbow and it was wrong - but he knows he was wrong . ` he has got to take his punishment and move on now . he has got a two-game ban - whether he gets back in the team thereafter we will see . lee mcculloch has been warned he could lose his place in the starting xi after being sent off against hearts ` since i 've been at the club he has done fine . he 's been good in the dressing room and his performances have been good . ` if whoever comes in over the next two games does really well , then he might not get back in . ` he 's not undroppable , no , but at this moment in time with the games we have played he has done nothing to merit being dropped . ' off the field , dave king now hopes to get the sfa 's blessing to take over as chairman after judges at the court of session approved his boardroom bid . but with 12 first-team players out of contract at the end of this season , mccall has warned his squad they may have to wait for new deals . he said : ' i do n't think it will be too long before dave becomes chairman of the club , so that is another positive move . ` i 'm just concentrating on the football . i 've spoken to a couple of directors about things but we have five games in 14 days so i 'm just focusing on that . ` as for contracts , that can only be sorted when the club knows what league it 's going to be playing in next season , so that is the key . ' the weekend victory over hearts moved rangers back into the box seat for the promotion play-offs . rangers boss stuart mccall has led his team to three consecutive victories in the scottish championship but that now leaves ex-motherwell boss mccall facing the ` nightmare ' scenario that he could come up against his former fir park troops . motherwell 's 5-0 victory over basement boys st mirren has all but spared them from the automatic relegation spot but ian baraclough 's team could yet be made to scrap for their premiership place against rangers in the play-off final . ` it 's not looking likely at all because motherwell are not going to finish in the bottom two - i hope , ' said mccall . ` first and foremost we have to do our job and get in the play-offs . ` but i said when motherwell signed scott mcdonald that i believed - and i still do - that they would have enough to get out of trouble . ' before that , though , mccall must continue to rack up the wins , starting with thursday 's trip to dumfries . rangers lost 2-0 on their last visit in december - just hours after it was revealed mccoist was stepping down as boss . ` i 'm still aghast because i 've just watched a video of the second half , ' said mccall . ' i have n't showed the players because i think they know they were not in a good place at that time . ` the news about ally broke on the afternoon of the game and it was just a down day . as much as rangers underperformed , all credit goes to queens . they are a good side , especially down there . we know how difficult it will be .

            "( cnn ) protests are gaining steam in baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody . demonstrators have vowed they 'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice . to start , protesters say they 're looking for answers about what happened to freddie gray , and why . but it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing . protesters rallied at baltimore city hall on thursday , and another march is planned for saturday . here 's a look at key issues protesters are asking about : police say when gray saw police on april 12 , he started running . within minutes , they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket . protesters have echoed the claims of the gray family 's attorney , who argues that police did n't have any probable cause to pursue him , but chased him for \" running while black . \" baltimore police union attorney michael davey told reporters wednesday that officers had every right to chase gray . \" there is a supreme court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area , and you flee from the police unprovoked , the police have the legal ability to pursue you , and that 's what they did , \" he said . \" in this type of an incident , you do not need probable cause to arrest . you just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop . \" an autopsy says gray died from a severe spinal cord injury . his family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died . police say they spotted gray , gave chase , caught him , cuffed him and requested a \" wagon \" to transport him in less than four minutes . the transport van left with gray about 11 minutes afterward , police said , and another 30 minutes passed before \" units request paramedics to the western district to transport the suspect to an area hospital . \" protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes , and say it 's clear police used too much force when gray was in their custody . investigators still have n't said what happened inside the van . union officials from the fraternal order of police lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle , but they do n't know what . baltimore police commissioner anthony batts told cnn affiliate wjz that another prisoner inside the van said he did n't see any harm done to gray . \" what he has said is that he heard freddie thrashing about , \" batts said . \" the driver did n't drive erratically , was n't slamming on breaks , was n't turning corners fast or in an irrational way . \" five of the six officers involved in gray 's arrest have provided statements to investigators , the baltimore police department said wednesday . \" they have completely cooperated with the investigation from day 1 , \" davey told reporters . but details of what the officers said have n't been released yet by authorities . neither have the officers ' personnel records or photos . police say doing that would violate the law . the lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public , and the lawmakers who represent them . protesters say police should be releasing what they know now . baltimore police officials say they 're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing . and they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the state attorney 's office next week . some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for gray 's death . officials say an investigation is ongoing , and all the officers involved have been suspended with pay . at this point , it is n't clear whether any charges will be filed . the u.s. justice department is also investigating the case . the police union said it 's 100 % behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob , accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court . \" there is , at this time , no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever , \" the union 's statement said , \" but our support will not waiver for any reason . \" gray 's case is getting a lot of attention . but protest organizers say it 's emblematic of a broader problem . some protesters say it 's not the only time they 've seen police brutality on the streets of their city . long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over gray 's death , some of them had already been at city hall , voicing their concerns over other cases . \" right now there 's a lot of mistrust . they feel it 's us versus them , \" baltimore city council president jack young said . \" it should not be that way and it needs to be fixed . \" according to the baltimore sun , the city has paid more than $ 5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing . police did n't admit fault in any of the cases . the police union said in a statement on wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple : city officials believe lawsuits are too costly . \" let us be clear , we completely disagree with this policy , as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but , rather , to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit . we believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given , \" the union said . \" the ease of settlement , and substantial award amount , has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints .

            "the small college town of missoula , montana , best known for its university and its inhabitants ' fierce love of football , has been branded in the media america 's rape capital , and now bestselling author jon krakauer has made it the subject of his new book documenting the explosive allegations . missoula : rape and the justice system in a college town , a doubleday publication that was released tuesday , immediately sparked a fierce debate in montana and beyond . krakauer , the author of the critically acclaimed book into the wild , sat down for an interview with abc 's nightline , which aired wednesday night , to discuss his latest project exploring the sensitive subject of campus rape . brave : kelsey belnap ( left ) and allison huguet ( right ) were among the five women profiled by author jon krakauer fopr his new book about sexual assault at the university of montana at missoula . miss belnap allegedly had been gang-raped by four college football players , but they were never charged survivor speaks : hillary mclaughlin had been raped by the same football player who attacked allison huguet during a party in 2010 . she later testified against him ( pictured ) convicted rapist : grizzly running back beau donaldson , huguet and mclaughlin 's attacker , pleaded guilty to rape in 2012 and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison jon krakauer argued that rape allegations were not unique to the picturesque town nestled in the rocky mountains , pointing out that missoula 's sexual abuse statistics were average , or even slightly below the national average . ` if this problem could exist in missoula , it could exist anywhere in the country , and it does . ' ` rape is this huge problem , 80 per cent of rapes are unreported . ' in an effort to shed light on the rape epidemic and spark a national conversation , krakauer had interviewed five alleged victims of rape for his book , among them kelsey belnap , who revealed that during her sophomore year at the university of montana , she was gang-raped by four members of the beloved local grizzy football team . speaking to nightline , miss belnap said on the night of the alleged attack in december 2010 , she was playing drinking games at an off-campus party celebrating the end of the finals . explosive : bestsellng author and journalist jon krakauer released missoula : rape and the justice system in a college town on april 21 she downed up to 11 shots of 99-proof alcohol within an hour and soon was slipping in and out of consciousness . ' i do n't remember bits and pieces until i had a penis in my face , ' she recalled . according to belnap , she pushed away the first football player who tried to have sex with her and told him she did n't want to sleep with him , but he forced himself on her , followed by three of his teammates . at some point , she passed out during the suspected attack . when the sophomore came to , she headed to a hospital and filed a police report . but according to miss belnap , investigating officers were far from sympathetic . ` they made it seem like it was alcohol , ' she said . ` that it was my fault , that i had drank too much , and if i would n't have drank too much , it would n't have happened . ' belnap argued that it was n't alcohol that crossed a line and ` stuck a penis ' in her face that night - it was four grizzly football players . in the end , missoula prosecutors ruled that there was no probable cause to charge belnap 's alleged attackers . police and prosecutors said that belnap had told investigators the men ` would have likely believed it was consensual sex ' - a claim that was repeated by the players and several witnesses at the party . miss belnap also made a statement to police that she was so drunk that night she did not resist the men 's advances . the missoula county attorney argued that the student was not legally incapacitated because she was going in and out of consciousness . under state law , a victim can not give consent to sex if he or she is ` mentally defective or incapacitated . ' after her case was essentially tossed out , belnap turned to university officials , and there things went a little better for her : one of her alleged attackers was expelled from school , another agreed to leave voluntarily and the other two had dropped out earlier . krakauer 's new book also features the story of another young woman , allison huguet , who was also raped by a university of montana football player whom she has known since childhood . huguet had left montana to attend an out-of-state college but returned to missoula in december 2010 for a party with her long-time friend , beau donaldson . huguet said she had been drinking and was in no condition to drive home that night , so she settled in for the night on the couch . belnap ( left ) claimed four players gang-raped her in 2010 , but prosecutors never charged them citing lack of probable cause ` and i woke up to a lot of pain , and a lot of pressure , and the sound of somebody moaning , and quickly realized it was beau , ' huguet said . ` i just shut my eyes and laid there , and that was n't , i do n't even think a decision , i consciously made . ' allison huguet said after the act , donaldson got up , pulled up his pants and threw a blanket on her . once he was out of earshot , she fled the house barefoot and called her mother for help . as she was on the phone telling her mother donaldson had raped her , she realized the hulking running back was chasing her . backlash : missoula county attorney kirsten pabst on wednesday called jon krakauer 's allegations ` inaccurate , exaggerated , and unnecessarily personal ' according to the woman , the grizzy player begged her not to tell anyone what happened . after she finally got away from him , huguet went to a hospital and underwent a rape kit exam , but at first she decided not to get the police involved . instead , huguet and her mother invited donaldson over to their home and secretly recorded their conversation , which eventually yielded a confession . at first , donaldson tried to blame their encounter on alcohol , but eventually he changed his story , saying on the audio recording : ` it 's something i did and i f *** ed up . ' he went on to say that he came close to killing himself the night of the attack . ' i was curled up on my couch in the carport with my f *** ing handgun in my hand . you have no idea , ' he lamented . huguet , in turn , made her childhood friend promise her he would get help . in exchange , she said she would not go to the police . but more than a year later , huguet learned that donaldson had n't sought counselling like he had promised and contacted the authorities . during an interview with police , the star grizzy player confessed to the rape . as she was struggling to push her case forward in the months following donaldson 's arrest , huguet discovered that another young woman , hillary mclaughlin , had accused him of raping her in 2008 but she never reported the attack to police . in an interview with nightline , mclaughlin said she is filled with remorse because she could have possibly prevented the attack on allison huguet had she blown the whistle on donaldson seven years ago . during donaldson 's trial , mclaughlin finally shared her story in court , helping seal the defendant 's fate . changes : the university created a small sexual assault prevention department last year and its athletic department created a new code of conduct that addresses sexual assault the department of justice investigated 350 sexual assaults reported to the missoula police between january 2008 and may 2012 in september 2012 , beau donaldson , the former star of the grizzlies , pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison . he will be up for parole in july . the disturbing news from missoula prompted the us department of justice to launch an investigation into the university of montana , the local police department and the prosecutor 's office . the federal probe found that between 2008 and 2012 , only 14 of the 85 total rape cases were sent by police to the prosecutor . justice department investigators determined that the missoula county attorney declined to prosecute nearly every case where drugs or alcohol played a role - even when the rapist had confessed . a june 2014 agreement ended the investigation , with the county agreeing to implement sweeping changes , including the creation of a special victims unit and the assignment of trained prosecutors to sexual assault cases . the university itself has created a small sexual assault prevention department last year with a coordinator and three interns , and its athletic department created a new code of conduct that addresses sexual assault , according to the montana kaimin . ` missoula is a much safer place for women now than it was when i first started looking at it in 2012 , ' krakauer said . missoula county attorney kirsten pabst on wednesday held a press conference to address the issues raised by jon krakauer 's latest book . ` while the charges that the author has made against me , my office , my predecessor , are inaccurate , exaggerated , and unnecessarily personal , he is correct . in that our investigation and prosecution standards needed to be improved , ' she stated . mr krakauer , pictured speaking in 2009 , is the best selling author of works such as into thin air and into the wild while mr krakauer 's story focuses on montana , the book 's scope is more global . missoula is described as ' a typical college town ' and mr krakauer 's website said that rape victims are ` deserving of compassion from society and fairness from a justice system that is clearly broken ' . mr krakauer decided to write the book ` after learning that a young woman with whom he and his wife have a close relationship suffered intensely in secret for many years after she was raped by a man she trusted , ' according to usa today . sexual assault and rape have become issues at campuses across the country , with victims speaking out against the way that universities dealt with their allegations . ninety-four colleges and universities were under investigation by the department of justice for their handling of sexual assault cases as of the beginning of this year . mr krakauer 's book says that it ` cuts through the abstract ideological debate about campus rape ' . the writer 's other works include into the wild , under the banner of heaven and into thin air , for which he was nominated for the pulitzer prize .\n",

' ` should chrva allow players the ability to move teams when they are unhappy with the amount of playtime they are receiving , we would be overwhelmed with requests to change teams , ' a league official wrote in a january 26 letter to audrey 's parents . the dimitrews ' attorney says that this is true in audrey 's case , but the league disagrees . an attorney for the league , kenneth g. stallard , declined to comment on the case wednesday on behalf of his client , saying they ` will not comment on active litigation matters . ' however the lawsuit turns out , audrey is likely out of luck for the season as only one tournament remains in the club season , though depending on nv premier 's season performance it may be eligible for other tournaments . ' i never imagined in my wildest dreams there would be a lawsuit over this , ' she audrey 's mother , susan . ` but i think it 's the right thing to do . i do n't think my child is the only one that has experienced something like this . they do n't think they have to answer to anyone .

            "ever wondered if your personality was decided at birth ? it turns out , the order in which you were born can not only have an effect on your personality , but also your chances of academic success . according to canadian duo mitchell moffit and greg brown , from toronto , who present an online science show , several theories suggest that where you are in your family determines who you are . ( pictured from left to right : khloé , kourtney and kim kardashian ) . the kardashians are a strong example of a large celebrity family where the siblings share very different personality traits on asapscience on youtube , the pair discuss how being the first , middle , youngest , or an only child affects us . the personality traits are also supposedly affected by whether parents have high expectations and how strict they were . according to mitchell and brown , first-born children are expected to be higher academic achievers and more ambitious . they also have a stronger sense of responsibility and are generally more mature . ( pictured from left to right ) beyoncé and kate middleton are famous first-borns . oldest children tend be ambitious and have strong leadership skills they also tend to have better leadership skills than other birth orders . the explanation is because although they get a lot more affection and attention from their parents , their parents have higher expectations as the first child . this works as a self-fulfilling prophecy : if there are high expectations placed on you , you are more likely to want to work hard and live up to these expectations . ( pictured from left to right ) kim kardashian and madonna are famous middle-borns . middle children tend to be co-operative and are more likely to be social butterflies middle-born children apparently tend to be more co-operative , flexible and sociable . they are also the birth order that are able to make and maintain friendships easily . this is due to the fact that as a middle-born child , there are n't the high expectations of the first child , nor the relaxed attitude accorded to the last child . as a result , they also tend to be less ambitious than their older brothers and sisters , and so will have a more relaxed attitude in life . as middle children receive less attention than their other siblings , they seek out relationships and friendships outside of their family , and can be social butterflies . ( pictured from left to right ) jennifer lawrence and angelina jolie are famous youngest children . last-borns tend to be charming and confident the video highlights how youngest children tend to be likeable and charming . other traits they carry are that they are more creative than older siblings , and have a stronger sense of security and confidence . as their parents have already had other children , they tend to be a lot less strict and are a lot more lenient with their youngest children . parents ' expectations will also be lower . as a result , youngest children will generally be less responsible and mature than older siblings , as they constantly feel like others will take the lead . ( pictured from left to right ) leonardo dicaprio and drew barrymore are famous only-children . only children tend to be creative and responsible only children tend to be academically-able , creative and resourceful . they are also mature and responsible , and dislike disorder and like to be in control . being a parent 's only child , expectations are always high , but unlike a first-born , they never need to fight for the attention of their parents . not to mention , being in a household with only adults often leads the child to mature more quickly and copy the actions of the parents , rather than being moulded by siblings ' childish or youthful interests . but because they have never had to interact with siblings or companions of a similar age , they can have trouble relating to peers and can feel out of control when things in their life do n't go their way . the presenters of the video highlight that these are just theories relating to order of birth . they add that gender , social status , age gaps between siblings and the number of siblings can play a huge role in determining traits . moffit and brown reiterate : ` some aspects may be true for you , or make a lot of sense , but it would n't be the same for every single person around the world in your specific birth order . ` it 's important to remember that your personality and your destiny in life is not predetermined at birth .

            "( cnn ) the nation 's top stories will be unfolding tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country . massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former new england patriot aaron hernandez and boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev . both lengthy trials are coming to a close . in louisville , kentucky , sen. rand paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in chicago , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between mayor rahm emanuel and challenger jesus \" chuy \" garcia . and in ferguson , missouri , the shadow of michael brown and the protests over his shooting by officer darren wilson will loom large over the city 's elections . here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : tsarnaev , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 boston marathon along with his now-deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism . the 13th juror : what defense ? on monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old \" brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets . \" the jury on tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so-called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts . it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd , yet on monday , hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day . closing arguments are scheduled for tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter . jurors in fall river , massachusetts , will be asked to decide if hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013 . much of the evidence against hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are new england patriots owner robert kraft 's testimony , the testimony of hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a nike air jordan shoe . hernandez known for swagger , even in court ok , sure , no one was floored when the kentucky senator announced his bid for the oval office , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday . paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in new hampshire , south carolina , iowa and nevada . the physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the senate in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional republicans to usher him into the white house . paul and sen. ted cruz are the only declared candidates for the gop nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of florida 's jeb bush , new jersey 's chris christie , wisconsin 's scott walker , south carolina 's lindsey graham and florida 's marco rubio . would rand be here without ron ? it 's the windy city 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the \" future of chicago . \" in one corner , you have emanuel , president barack obama 's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have jesus \" chuy \" garcia , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal democrats ' frustrations with the chicago incumbent . after emanuel failed to snare half the vote in february 's general election , he will go head-to-head with garcia . the timing is interesting , too , as easter , passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in february . following michael brown 's death , the national spotlight shone on ferguson , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and city council . yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in november to cast ballots . residents speak out ahead of vote tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election . in another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat . and a white protester is running for a third post .\n",

            "lausanne , switzerland ( cnn ) a roller-coaster series of talks wrapped up thursday in lausanne as a group of world powers known as the p5 +1 reached a framework agreement with iran over the country 's nuclear program . the success of that agreement remains to be seen . the parties have until the end to june to work out the details and put the plan to paper . but the talks this week were , nevertheless , historic , particularly for the otherwise frozen u.s.-iranian relationship . but that 's not to say they were glamorous . in fact , the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best , but also at its most hectic . tucked amid the swiss alps on the shores of lake geneva , lausanne is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of camp david for the rich and famous . but make no mistake : the site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage . over the course of the eight-day round of talks , negotiators , their delegations , their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five-star beau-rivage palace hotel , which played host to the negotiations . this is n't the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event . in 1923 , the treaty of lausanne was signed there , breaking up the ottoman empire and defining the borders of modern-day turkey . more recently , the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity . coco chanel famously lived there in the late 1940s and early 1950s , and even had her dog buried on the hotel grounds , some reports say . ` it was tough , very intense at times ' the setting is idyllic , and the grounds are beautifully maintained . the first-floor terrace even features a large-scale chess board , which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside . for the negotiators , the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings , sometimes lasting throughout the night . in an interview with cnn shortly after the framework agreement was announced , secretary of state john kerry said , \" i think there was a seriousness of purpose \" in meetings with the iranians . \" people negotiated hard , \" he added . \" it was tough , very intense at times , sometimes emotional and confrontational . \" that sentiment was echoed by iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif even as the talks were still going on . over the past 18 months since talks began , zarif said , negotiators have \" developed personal respect \" for one another , even though serious mistrust still exists between iran and the western powers . \" we have a very serious problem of confidence -- mutual lack of confidence we need to address -- and we hope that this process will remedy some of that , \" he added . zarif made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake thursday . such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels . kerry was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another , with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes . reporters briefly followed chinese foreign minister wang yi as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in lausanne on sunday . and zarif took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel , perhaps just hoping to take in the view , but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock . the officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus , but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations , making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts . \" people often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation , \" a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to lausanne , \" as do the iranians . \" \" i think they 're quite skilled , actually , at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation , \" the official said . more than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week . many of these were based in a large workspace at the nearby olympic museum . meanwhile , the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges , allowing them access to the hotel , where the talks took place . while these journalists had a bit more access to officials , they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building , including the hotel 's reception desk , the first-floor restrooms and the two-michelin-star restaurant 's entrees , costing 200 francs or more . many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar , a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline . for meals , the crowd dispersed to a dozen or so nearby restaurants , where they could enjoy 25-franc pizzas and 60-franc hamburgers , washed down with 8-franc bottles of water , of course . also popular : a thai place around the corner that offered quick takeout -- a plus for reporters on a deadline . ` we 'd all take deep breaths and try again ' in the closed-off wings of the beau-rivage , the pace of meetings was frantic as different subsets of delegates gathered in ornate conference rooms . there was a sense of urgency , both before and after the initial march 31 deadline passed , to reach a final understanding so the foreign ministers could leave switzerland ahead of other time commitments , not to mention the easter holiday . the process was further complicated by restrictions on the flight crew for kerry 's plane , which could stay on standby at the airport for only a limited number of hours in a given time period . \" we 'd get close , we kept on changing the plane schedule , \" a senior administration official told reporters . \" it would go , it would n't go ; we had to reset the clock . \" on the evening the understanding was finally announced , the window had already lapsed , requiring kerry and his team to depart at 3 a.m. friday . there were \" many moments ( throughout the negotiations ) when we thought we 'd call it a day , call it a night , decide we 'd gone as far as we could go , \" said the official , who briefed reporters on kerry 's plane . \" then we 'd all take deep breaths and try again . \" but perhaps the most difficult night for negotiators was between wednesday and thursday , just before the final sticking points were resolved for a deal . \" it was a very , very intense , \" said the official . \" it went from 9 -- about 9 in the evening until 6 in the morning when we all decided we 'd reached a couple of roadblocks , did n't know whether we 'd be able to get past them , and we were all utterly , utterly exhausted . \" \" so we all went to sleep by maybe 7 , got up again and started again about 9:30 , and engaged on what we thought were the really final issues , \" the official added . that morning , the deal began to solidify , and plans for the announcement were set into motion . the announcement that an agreement had been reached sparked some chaos . it was first sent out by the european delegation , which spread the word to its traveling press corps even as negotiators were still meeting . as news began to get out , one european reporter ran frantically into the media area at the hotel , urging everyone to listen . his message : there 's going to be an announcement . there are buses waiting to take you to the auditorium of a nearby university where it will take place . and with that , the room devolved into chaos as journalists ran for the doors . the eight-day-long diplomatic event had hit its crescendo before finally subsiding . by midday friday , the delegations had left lausanne , along with most of the media , returning the scenic swiss city to its more tranquil pace .\n",

            "last weekend , after a sunny day in the borders , i posted this picture of myself on twitter with the caption ` just met nicola sturgeon lookalike out canvassing ! ' i admit , it was n't a particularly funny joke , but i had no idea of the outrage my light-hearted comment would provoke from the devoted followers of scotland 's first minister and the leader of the snp . i was called ugly , vile , ` someone who deserves to die ' , and one wit even ` hoped i would catch malaria ' . in all , i 've probably received more than 600 insults , and two days later they 're still coming . luckily , i 've got a thick skin , but whatever happened to free speech ? in the knockabout atmosphere of an election campaign , everything is up for debate . janet street-porter posted this picture on twitter with the caption ` just met nicola sturgeon lookalike out canvassing ! ' both the press and the public routinely talk about politicians in less-than-flattering terms , mocking their trendy ( or spartan ) kitchens , their silly casual clothes and their strange hairstyles , not to mention their attempts to eat a bacon sandwich , hug babies , cook a casual lunch or chuck a bowling ball -- all in the name of a photo opportunity . the uk is home to a rich and raucous tradition of political satire , from 19th century caricaturists such as george cruikshank and james gillray , to more recent cartoonists gerald scarfe , ralph steadman and those in private eye magazine , as well as tv series such as spitting image , mock the week and have i got news for you . most of our most successful comedians sneer at the party leaders . so you might imagine that the scots could cope with a few harmless jibes about their own first minister . wrong , wrong , wrong . all the pollsters agree that the snp is destined to win the vast majority of the seats ( up to 50 ) north of the border in the general election , crushing the tories and trouncing labour . they already control the majority of votes in the scottish assembly . could this surge of nationalism mean that scotland is in danger of becoming another north korea , a land where the ` dear leader ' is sacrosanct , a figure on a pedestal , to be worshipped and admired -- but never criticised ? at the weekend , one commentator announced that ` scotland has fallen in love with nicola -- she is adored ' . indeed last night ms sturgeon was as feisty as ever in the leaders ' debate . my goodness , you certainly could n't say that about any party leader south of the border , or in wales . despite all the photo calls at factories , in schools and cafes and villages halls , poll after poll shows that the public find most british politicians ` out of touch ' . ed miliband and nick clegg have ` minus ' personal ratings , while even ukip 's nigel farage , once the poster boy for the disaffected , could be in danger of losing his bid to become an mp in south thanet . janet street-porter said she had no idea of the outrage her ` light-hearted comment ' would provoke from nicola sturgeon 's ( pictured ) supporters so how has nicola sturgeon become teflon woman , a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? according to her followers , i am a traitor to my sex , a woman less attractive than red rum , a sub-human who should be neutered . it 's all beginning to sound like a repressive communist state . sadly , some snp supporters combine commendable patriotism with a deep-seated distrust of the english -- not just the posh people from down here , but anyone born in the ` wrong ' country . i first encountered this when i made an hour-long documentary for bbc scotland last year , looking at voting intentions in the independence referendum . i love scotland and have spent many happy weeks walking , working and fishing there , so making this film was a real pleasure . i talked to people of all persuasions in the borders , the central belt between glasgow and edinburgh , and in the north-east . we went to inordinate lengths to present a scrupulously balanced film -- but when it was transmitted , because i was born in england ( and am actually half-welsh ) i was attacked in the scottish press , on twitter and other social media for having the audacity to host a programme about ` their ' country . some snp members are so consumed with themselves that all they want is people to agree with them , and sod everyone else . they are blinkered zealots incapable of reasoned debate . during their aggressive campaign for independence -- which got the knockback by a sizeable margin , with 55 pc in favour of remaining in the uk -- the nationalists earned a reputation for ruthlessly attacking anyone who did n't agree with them . the author j.k. rowling was denounced as unpatriotic for daring to speak out in favour of scotland remaining part of the uk . dubbed the tartan taliban and the cyber nats , fanatical snp followers use social media to ` troll ' opponents , and anyone daring to criticise their leader . when the bbc political editor nick robinson reported from scotland on the referendum last year , the nationalists took such offence to what they regarded as his biased broadcasts that hundreds of marchers took to the streets carrying a huge banner with the words ` sack nick \" the liar \" robinson , a totally corrupt journalist ' . but they do n't stop at professional attacks . when robinson announced a few weeks ago that he had a cancerous tumour on his lung , the cyber nats went straight on twitter with comments such as ` a bit of chemotherapy would do the biased beeb man good ' . in similar vein , after a daily mail writer published a profile of nicola sturgeon in these pages recently , he was attacked relentlessly online , and called a nazi , racist scum , a vile bigot , a misogynist , and told to f *** off back to england . many of those abusing him had a blue nationalist ` 45 ' logo on their twitter feed , to represent the percentage who voted for independence last year . so what of the woman these people idolise as some great political saviour unlike any other figure in britain today ? janet street-porter ( right ) asks how nicola sturgeon ( left ) has become ' a person so perfect that a mere joke about her appearance means ( according to her fans ) i can no longer be considered a feminist ? ' consider the facts : ms sturgeon , just like ed miliband , has spent her whole life ( apart from a brief period working as a solicitor ) entirely engrossed in politics . her husband and her former boyfriends and most of her friends all work for the snp . yet it is ed miliband , not sturgeon , who gets derided for being ` weird ' and having not experienced the real world . from 1992 onwards , she unsuccessfully stood for seat after seat in local and national elections , before eventually gaining a place in the scottish parliament via a quota system in 1999 . she had a total image make-over in 2004 -- hiring a stylist , changing her krankies-style hairdo , losing weight and softening her approach . but make no mistake , she is as ruthless an operator as any other party leader . her stated goal is scottish independence , no matter what effect that might have on the rest of the uk , even though her party lost what was supposed to be a ` once-in-a-generation ' vote on this issue last year . when questioned on television this week , she refused to rule out a second referendum in the very near future . when it comes to dealing with the deficit and setting out an economic strategy , cameron , miliband and clegg have had their plans ruthlessly dissected . sturgeon , however , based her sums on an oil boom that has failed to materialise , which has deprived the scottish economy of billions of pounds of expected revenue . she wants scotland to be responsible for raising its own taxes , but when an independent think-tank , the institute for fiscal studies , looked at her plans for tax and spending and said they would result in a whopping # 7.6 billion deficit , she described their findings as ` irrelevant ' . yes , i admire nicola sturgeon 's tenacity , and i applaud any woman who rises to the top in her chosen profession . i know from experience just how tough that can be . nevertheless , we find ourselves in the unenviable position of facing an election where a party that 60 million britons can not vote for -- the snp -- could hold the balance of power at westminster . it is a self-proclaimed ` progressive ' party which hypocritically accepted # 2.5 million of donations from brian souter , the stagecoach boss who does n't believe in equal rights for gays . does that make her any different to ed miliband , with his much-criticised relationships with the trade unions , or david cameron with his cronies in big business ? voters in england can do nothing to stop the sturgeon bandwagon gaining momentum -- snp membership has tripled in the past year , and it 's now the third-largest political party in the uk . but worrying questions remain about some of her followers . by trying to stifle debate and silence any jokes ( no matter how feeble ) about their leader , they are beginning to look more like fanatics than political supporters .\n",

            "the tennessee supreme court postponed execution dates for four inmates , effectively halting all executions while the courts decide whether current protocols for putting people to death are constitutional . tennessee last executed a prisoner in 2009 . since then , legal challenges and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have stalled new executions . in 2013 and 2014 , the state tried to jump-start the process with a new one-drug lethal injection method and the reinstatement of the electric chair as a backup . the tennessee supreme court has vacated the execution dates of the last four men on the state 's death row as new lethal injection methods are challenged . above , electrocution has been designated as a backup method beginning in december 2013 , the court set new execution dates for 11 inmates . one inmate died in prison , and the execution dates for the others have been postponed as they approach because of legal challenges to the new methods . on friday , the court postponed the last of the scheduled execution dates . it will set new dates after the legal questions are settled . states across the country have been struggling to find a method of execution that will stand up to legal challenges . and obtaining lethal injection drugs has been getting harder . as manufacturers have refused to sell drugs to prisons for executions , prison officials across the us have turned to compounding pharmacies , which make drugs specifically for individual clients . but those versions have also become difficult to come by because pharmacists are reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment . last month , the american pharmacists association adopted a policy discouraging its members from providing drugs for lethal injections , saying that runs contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers . death row inmates challenging tennessee 's lethal injection method recently submitted an affidavit from university of utah college of pharmacy professor james h. ruble that questions whether even a willing compounding pharmacist could provide the pentobarbital that tennessee and several other states need for executions . leroy hall jr , 48 ( left ) and nicholas todd sutton , 53 ( right ) were both convicted of murder in 1991 and 1985 , respectively . they no longer have dates for execution in tennessee donald strouth , 56 ( left ) and abu-ali abdur ` rahman , 64 ( right ) were also both convicted of murder , though the european union has called for abdur ` rahman , who is believed to be mentally ill , to be allowed to live ruble says in the affidavit that the main ingredient for pentobarbital is unavailable from the six primary commercial sources that compounding pharmacists buy their ingredients from . the tennessee supreme court 's recent ruling will vacate the execution dates for leroy hall jr , 48 , donald wayne strouth , 56 , nicholas todd sutton , 53 , and abu-ali abdur ' rahman , 64 . hall was convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated arson after burning his ex-girlfriend to death in 1991 . strouth was convicted of murdering a clothing store owner in 1978 by slitting his throat after he was knocked unconscious with a rock . sutton was sentenced to death for stabbing a fellow inmate to death in 1985 after originally being sent to prison for child molestation . abdur ` rahman , formerly james lee jones , received his death penalty sentence for the murder of a nashville cocaine dealer in 1986 while he was a remember of a militant christian group looking to eliminate drugs from its neighborhood . the case of abdur ` rahman , who was reportedly seriously abused by his parents as a child , has drawn international attention and the european union called for a stay . he is believed to be mentally ill and had ineffective counsel during his trial , according to his website . there are 69 people on tennessee 's death row . the tennessee supreme court ( pictured ) is waiting for verdicts about the constitutionality of the lethal injection drug pentobarbital tennessee last year reinstated electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or a court rules the procedure unconstitutional . but that change has brought yet another legal challenge . other states of the 31 with the death penalty are considering their own alternatives . utah last month reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it ca n't obtain lethal injection drugs . in oklahoma , lawmakers approved nitrogen gas as a backup execution method . the state 's republican governor mary fallin supports the death penalty but has not said whether she will sign the bill . pennsylvania governor tom wolf suspended his state 's death penalty in february , citing the inefficiency of long court proceedings and expense . ohio and georgia are delaying all of their executions while investigation their lethal injection drug protocols . the us supreme court will hear a case later this month about the first substance in a so-called ` three drug cocktail ' , which is supposed to render the person being executed unconscious so they will not feel pain for the second two drugs . scrutiny on the death penalty has increased since an execution using the drug , midazolam , resulted in an oklahoma inmate writhing in presumed pain before dying 43 minutes after the procedure began . tennessee uses only one drug in its protocol , the sedative pentobarbital . there are 69 people in death row in the state , according to the department of corrections . the tennessee supreme court order said that their execution dates have previously been vacated for legal challenges .\n",

' i had such a long year personally . ... it was very emotional in more ways than anybody could understand . ' but for redman , standing on the court in kansas city and celebrating the dalton roadrunners ' first-ever naia championship victory - they beat westmont college of california 71-53 - was a bittersweet moment because his biggest cheerleader , brittany , was not there . ` now i realize more and more each day what i learned from her and what i learned from that whole situation so yea , good things can happen from bad things , ' he said . the past 11 months have been the most challenging in john redman 's life . on april 28 , 2014 , redman was driving his future wife from dalton , georgia , to her hometown of mobile , alabama , when he lost control of his lexus in a rainstorm . the car blew a tire , hydroplaned and smashed into a bridge column on interstate 85 in merriweather county , georgia , killing the 23-year-old bride in impact . inseparable : the couple had been together since 2011 and were just five days from their wedding wreckage : they were driving from georgia to her hometown of mobile , alabama when redman lost control of his car and smashed into the median , killing his fiancee on impact ' i do n't remember the accident at all , ' redman told 11 alive . the young basketball coach was rushed to a hospital and spent more than two weeks in a coma with five broken ribs , three surgically removed ribs , 21 skull fractures and eight broken teeth . ` they [ doctors ] told my parents i 'd be in assisted living the rest of my life ... that i 'd never come back to work . i 'd be in a wheelchair . i might never talk again , ' redman recalled . after a month in the hospital , redman finally asked to see brittany for the first time since the accident . ' i was mad at her because she had n't come to visit me . i 'm in the hospital , she has n't visited me one time , ' he said . that is when huber 's parents broke the devastating news to redman that his wife-to-be did n't make it . redman and huber had been together since the fall of 2011 , and the couple got engaged in june 2013 . in july of that year , then-23-year-old graduate of spring hill college was hired as assistant men 's basketball coach at dalton state . his fiancee worked as a kindergarten teacher 's aide at city park elementary school . huber had a severe hearing impairment since she was a girl , but her students and people who met her for the first time often could n't pick up on it because of her uncanny ability to read lips hanging by a thread : redman survived the crash but was left with a cracked skull and broken ribs , and was told he would likely spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair . for the first month in the hospital , he had no idea that huber has died miracle : against overwhelming odds , redman recovered and was able to walk out of the hospital and resume coaching ( pictured ) on the eve of their fateful road trip to mobile , brittany wrote on her instagram page : ` i ca n't wait to ride on this journey with him and see what our amazing god has in store for us . ' just hours before her death , huber posted a photo of their journey , with the caption : ` it is finally wedding week ! ' the church where the couple were due to marry on may 3 was instead the venue for her memorial service . seven women wore matching mint green dresses - their bridesmaids dresses - to the service , al.com reported at the time . john redman says he felt brittany 's presence in the hospital every day , as always cheering him on . ' i felt brittany was there the whole time , and she was telling me to get up , get out , you do n't want to be here , go live your life , ' he recalled . and that is exactly what redman did , to the surprise of his doctors who called his recovery a miracle . back on the court : redman ( far right ) started out slowly , working part-time at dalton a couple of hours a day smiling again : redman said that working with the team , including assistant men 's basketball coach tony ingle jr ( left ) , was a form of therapy for him ` when you hear a doctor say you 're a miracle , you probably are a miracle , they do n't use that world very easily or lightly , ' he told wrcb . after weeks of physical therapy , redman resumed coaching . he started out slowly , working part-time a couple of hours a day and using his time with the team as a form of therapy . ` just having something to look forward to , and something to do , it 's given me hope , made me excited again . they saved my life , ' redman said . that is why for redman and the roadrunners , winning the title for the first time since dalton launched its basketball program two years ago was more than a sports victory . ` it really has been the best year and the worst year of my life , ' redman concluded .\n",

            "a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay - in a fight that has cost taxpayers # 200,000 . the 78 irish travellers , who hail from just four families , had refused to budge despite facing three different courts , a planning inquiry and a council . and locals in hardhorn , lancashire , accused the group of trashing their leafy village - and branded them the ` neighbours from hell ' . a gipsy group who exploited human rights laws to stay in their illegal camp for more than five years have won another legal battle to stay the group claimed the eviction ` violated ' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans last october , the camp , which had flouted planning rules , appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the court of appeal . but despite being given four months to leave the site without the chance to appeal , the group used a loophole to take their case to the supreme court . they claimed the eviction ` violated ' the human rights of the 39 children living on the site in 60 caravans . the supreme court later rejected pleas for the group to be allowed the right of appeal under a ` point of law of general public importance . ' but now it has been revealed that a further judicial review at the high court has been granted . fylde council said that fighting the ` battle of hardhorn ' has already cost the local authority # 200,000 in legal fees which will be met by the public purse . parish councillor maxine chew said : ` it is a disgrace that a shocking amount of public money has been spent fighting this . ` the travellers really have been the neighbours from hell . the amount of anti-social behaviour like fly tipping , theft , drunkenness has escalated hugely in the past four years since the travellers set up camp . ' the camp ( pictured ) appeared to have lost its case after the travellers were told to move out by the court of appeal last year a village spokesman added : ` after five years five months the travellers site have fought every decision , we believe that they have used legal aid to fight the secretary of state and fylde bc . ` the question what we would like to know is how these people qualified for legal aid ? using taxpayers ' money to fight the taxpayer ! ' he added the decision to hold a judicial review on the grounds presented is ` totally wrong ' . ` this community will be devastated with this news as we have been so patient and have endured over 450 negative incidents over the five-plus years . ` over eight caravans set on fire to burn refuse , horses killed & dogs killed on the road from the site , drunken labourers asleep in gardens , police raids and many cases of asb . ` the judge might have had a different view if he lived by this site . we wanted this ordeal to come to an end . there are or have been three houses for sale in hardhorn and not one has sold in the 5 years . ` how can the application that is being challenged suddenly be overturned using a new application , the hearing was on the old application . ' a judge gave permission for the judicial review application to proceed after arguments over legal technicalities regarding the processes of planning permission . fylde council said the legal battle has already cost the local authority # 200,000 which will be met by the public purse the saga began after a field in the village was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from west yorkshire the full judicial review will be held on either july 29 or 30 . the saga began in november 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in bbc 's gardeners world - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from west yorkshire . the travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a ` military-style operation ' and after council offices had closed for the weekend the group of around 30 adults and 40 children , from irish and scottish families , immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights . angry villagers wrote to local councillors , raising concerns about noise , road safety and a potential drop in house prices with one saying he and his wife had not been able to sleep due to noise from the site . locals had complained of the travellers leaving generators running 24 hours a day , poaching , trespassing , and leaving dogs to bark all night , while others had complained they had been verbally abused . officials at fylde district council later went to a district judge to stop the group laying hardcore foundations to make their 2.4 hectare site more permanent . they were granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land but were ordered to allow them to bring water to the site and to use power generators . locals in hardhorn , lancashire ( pictured above ) accused the camp 's ( pictured nearby ) occupants of trashing their leafy village but in 2010 , a county court judge then told the authorities to ` use their best endeavours ' to help the travellers get a post code for the land from the post office . at the time , the travellers argued they needed a postcode to help fire and ambulance crews find them if they were in need of an emergency - and the ruling meant they could also apply for state benefits , plus utilities including gas electricity and water . the group then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings , cesspools , fencing and hardstandings . fylde council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site . an inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave . but a travellers group representative elizabeth collins then appealed and took the matter to the high court in september 2012 . there , another judge ruled the planning inspector 's decision should stand . he also ordered miss collins to pay # 8,000 in costs . the group were initially given until july last year to quit - but just days before the council 's deadline for the travellers to move , miss collins lodged an appeal which further delayed the eviction . arguing the enforcement notices were ` unlawful ' , she said the eviction would force her and her extended family on to the roadside , which will have a major impact on the children living on the site . she added that the children 's human rights were ` violated ' as eviction would affect their health and educational prospects .\n",

' i just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this ( media attention ) , i guess , and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed . i just wanted to get away from it all , and i feel like it 's been a good thing . ' all eyes have been on tiger woods ' latest comeback , which could take the pressure off of mcilroy the northern irishman speaks to wood 's girlfriend lindsey vonn and his children during practice mcilroy followed woods into the media centre at augusta national and admitted the presence of the 14-time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour . ' a little bit , i guess , ' the 25-year-old added . ` it is such a big story , tiger coming back at the masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around . but still i 'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories , i wo n't read them and we 'll move on . ' mcilroy has recorded just one top-10 finish in six previous appearances at augusta - last year 's tie for eighth - although he did take a four-shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80 . he admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on sunday , covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion bubba watson , who finished eight shots ahead . mcilroy led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown mcilroy plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year 's tournament but he also believes augusta national suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th . ' i think i 've developed a game where i can compete at pretty much any golf course now . that might not have been the case two or three years ago , ' mcilroy added . ` but if you 're looking at the courses , augusta 's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here , especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left . ` if i can play the way i know i can around here and just have a good week on the greens , then there 's no reason why i should n't have a good chance .

' mark kellet prosecuting said : ` they had met on facebook and started dating . she describes that they were very much in love , and the pregnancy was planned because they were so in love . ` she moved in with dusan and his parents and there was , she says , significant animosity between their respective parents . while living with dusan , she missed her parents and this caused friction within the relationship and she deiced to return home . ` in the arguments that followed she describes the defendant as physically and verbally abusive and she turned-off her phone because she says the defendant had made threats towards her . he sent a text message to her father asking him to tell her to turn-on her telephone , which she did . ` he then asked her to come outside and speak to him . she says that she was reluctant because he had previously made threats about punching her in the stomach . when she told him that she did not wish to go outside to speak to him , he became threatening , saying that he would come into the house and cause trouble . ` when she left the house , her mother could see the defendant dragging her by her sweatshirt , so she and her husband followed . her mother shouted : \" why are you dragging her like this , she 's pregnant . \" bako put his arm around the back of the girl 's neck and with the other clenched his fist and repeatedly punched the victim in the stomach ` once they had entered a park , the defendant grabbed the girl around the neck and punched her in the stomach , a forceful and deliberate blow targeting her stomach area . she immediately doubled up in pain . ' eye witness carol hulme , who was walking her dog said in a statement : ` as the male ran in and grabbed the young female , he stopped suddenly and put his arm around the back of her neck . ` with the other arm he clenched his fist , swung his arm back and punched the female in the stomach . as soon as he punched her , he swung his arm back again and repeated the punch in the same area whilst still grabbing her around the neck . ` he hit her like a boxer would hit his opponent . it seemed more of a targeted strike . she could n't move , the way he had hold of her . i 've never seen anyone hit someone like that so low down . ` it would have been between her stomach and her private area . the best was to describe the direction of the punch is like an uppercut , the fist down striking upwards . i am still thinking how strange it is that she was hit that low . ' bako fled the scene as the girl let out an ` ungodly scream . ' she was taken to hospital where the baby 's heartbeat began to slow . the girl was given a scan and watched the monitor screen as the baby died . she describes being in great pain . mr kellet added : ` this was caused as a result of the injury to the girl caused by the punch . in essence , the punch to the stomach caused a placental haemorrhage and abruption . bako was jailed for fours years , eight months at manchester crown court , pictured , after admitting causing grievous bodily harm with intent ` the foetus became starved of oxygen and died . ' bako later surrendered to police and told officers the punch was accidental . he said : ' i took her to the park , her mum was shouting at me and then came up behind me and tried to slap me . ' i tried to hit her to defend myself , but i caught her in the stomach by mistake . i never intended to hit her or hurt the baby . \" in mitigation , defence counsel peter warne said : ` we are not dealing with a mature 18 year old . this was a complete instant loss of self-control and an ` emotional reaction to a situation that confronted him . he wishes to write a letter of apology . he wants to do what he can to make amends even if only writing a letter to explain how sorry he is . iit is not easy for someone of his age and immaturity to face up to what he has done and be brave enough to enter the plea he did for a very serious offence . ' jailing him for four years , eight months , today judge robert atherton told bako : ` you delivered a serious blow to the lower stomach of your girlfriend who was pregnant with your child and as a result of that blow described as a boxer delivering an upper cut , the placenta of the child was ruptured which lead to starvation of oxygen , terminating the pregnancy .

' safe and well : authorities say they 've found a 15-year-old girl , savannah bell , who they had thought to be in the company of convicted murderer who escaped from jail . bukowski told reporters that the detention center has lost between 15 and 20 per cent of its staff , forcing guards to work extra hours in a change that he said did not go unnoticed by the 450 inmates . asked whether he thought staffing at the jail was adequate , bukowski told reporters he would like to see the levels that pre-dated the budget cuts , acknowledging that guards working overtime ` get tired and they start to make mistakes . ' ` the inmates could see them working a double shift and see that they were tired , ' he said . ` so all those factors contribute to what 's going on . ' he said budget cuts also got in the way of planned security enhancements , but he refused to go into specifics on that or precise staffing numbers , saying ` the inmates already know too much .

' her condition means that external exposure to water is the main problem , rather than drinking liquid . the situation has become so bad that hugging her children can trigger an episode , as their body heat makes her sweat - and she has trained herself not to cry . however , she added an allergic reaction tended to depend on the circumstances . ` for example , if peter was to give me a kiss on a hot day when i 'm flushed , i 'd probably flare up , but maybe not if i was in a cool environment , ' she said . ` it can be frustrating but he 's really supportive . ` after years together , it 's become normal . you learn how to get used it . but it can be bothersome . ' mrs armitage now faces a daiily battle to protect her skin from agonising flare-ups - and has also been forced to give up her job as a cleaner because she can not not touch water . even hugging her children katie , nine , emily , two and four-year-old step-daughter savannah , can become a nightmare as their body heat can trigger a reaction . ` it affects every aspect of my day to day life , ' she said . ' i have to choose between doing the washing up and bathing my kids . my hands ca n't take them both -- it 's too painful . ' she added : ` when i 've got my children sat on me giving me a cuddle their body heat can cause me to sweat and have a reaction . her condition has become so bad that her hugging her children can trigger an episode , as their body heat makes her sweat - and bathing them can be problematic ` even tears can trigger the hives . i 've had to train myself not to cry . ` i 've learned not to get too angry or frustrated , as this can make my body flush and cause me to sweat , which can be very painful . ' due to her condition , mrs armitage must ensure she bathes in under 10 minutes to try and minimise the allergic reaction . ` i 've found the closer the water is to body temperature the faster i react , so i have really hot baths to try lessen the reaction , ` she siad . ' i also do n't drink cold water - it feels quite sharp at the back of my throat - so i stick to coffee . ' mrs armitage , who has to keep antihistamines and an epipen with her at all times , also suffers from exercise-induced anaphylaxis . previously a size eight , with a keen interest in fitness , the exercise allergy combined with side effects of her medication have seen her expand to a size 14 . she discovered this second allergy just months after her urticaria diagnosis after playing on a nintendo wii fit game at home . ` it was completely out of the blue , ' she said . ' i could n't breathe , i was on the floor struggling to get air into my lungs . ` thankfully , i stopped the exercising straight away and my breathing slowed , but i was left feeling quite sick for a few days afterwards . ' the mother-of-two suffers from the ultra-rare condition aquagenic urticaria -- an allergy to water . she was diagnosed two years ago after her skin erupted in agonising blisters when she got caught in a rain storm . swellings known as weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water she can now tell when an episode may strike - and knows she must stop whatever she 's doing when she feels the earning signs . ' i ca n't articulate what 's happening at the time - it all becomes quite foggy in my head , ' she said . on another occasion , mrs armitage was forced to sit on the floor , gasping for breath in the middle of leeds ' white rose shopping centre after a reaction was triggered by simply walking up a flight of stairs . in a vicious cycle , the anaphylactic reaction causes her to sweat which , in turn , triggers her water allergy . she said : ` the two worst episodes i 've had have been after no more than five minutes -- the equivalent to a warm up . urticaria , also known as hives or nettle rash , is a condition in which short-lived swellings occur anywhere on the body . these swellings ( weals ) may be pale , pink , or red , of different sizes and shape and itchy . as the raised weals flatten , they leave red marks that disappear usually in a day . new weals may then appear in other areas the itchy reaction is caused by the release of histamine in response to a number of different triggers . some form of it affects 20 per cent of people at some point . however , aquagenic urticaria - triggered by water of any temperature - is extremely rare . the weals appear between 15 minutes and two hours after exposure to water . in more severe cases drinking water can cause minor swelling in the throat . there is no known cure . symptoms can be lessened by reducing exposure - such as taking quick showers , applying petroleum jelly to the skin as well as taking anti-histamines . ` i 've had to rule out exercise completely now , it 's just too much of a worry . ' mrs armitage , who has spoken out as part of allergy awareness week , has also had to teach eldest daughter katie how to administer an epipen injection . now , she faces a daily checklist to ensure she 's done everything she can to avoid reactions . ` before leaving the house i have to ask myself if i can get to the bus stop or if it 's too far and likely to trigger my reactions , ' she said . ' i have to check if it 's going to rain and make sure i have back-up clothing in case i get too hot or too cold . ` my social life has gone to pot . ` before , i could just say , \" of course i 'll come out ' but now , it 's , \" where are we going ? can i park somewhere close so i do n't have to walk and risk my anaphylaxis triggering ? \" ' ` there are all these stupid little things i have to consider . ' amena warner , nurse advisor at allergy uk said : ` urticaria is also known as nettle rash or hives . ` it is a red raised itchy rash and is very common , affecting one person in five at some point in their life . ` in most people , it settles quickly and is no more than a mild inconvenience , but in some people it can be severe and long lasting . ' a very rare form of urticaria is that which is triggered by water , which is called aquagenic urticaria , the red raised itchy rash comes up on contact with water . ` treatment can help the symptoms and the person should receive specialist information from an allergist/immunologist .

' mr gemmell met with victim richard kerr , who claimed he was one of three youngsters trafficked from kincora ( pictured ) before being molested by ` very powerful ' figures in a westminster paedophile gang speaking to channel 4 news , mr kerr , who now lives in dallas , texas , said he and two other boys suffered abuse at kincora in the mid-1970s before being trafficked to london in 1977 , where they suffered further abuse . boys - many in local authority care - are alleged to have been abused by figures including the late liberal mp cyril smith , cabinet ministers , clergymen , pop stars , spies , judges and members of the royal household . mi5 has been accused of suppressing allegations of child abuse against the politician , who died in 2010 , when they were made during the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s . the kincora children 's home in east belfast was run by william mcgrath , the head of an extreme protestant loyalist group called tara and an alleged mi5 informant . he and two other members of staff -- william semple and joseph mains -- were jailed in 1981 for sexually assaulting boys in their care . in february , lawyers for victims challenging the refusal to include kincora in justice goddard 's wide-ranging inquiry told the high court in belfast that mi5 was aware of the abuse but allowed it to continue to protect those responsible from prosecution .\n",

            "( cnn ) just before writing this column , i reached into the depths of my wallet , and in between the pilot licenses , i slid out a postage stamp-size certificate issued by the federal aviation administration . the certificate documents my successful completion of the dc special flight rules area , or sfra , online course . the online course verifies that i am knowledgeable to fly a plane under visual flight rules into the most highly restricted u.s. airspace in the country . although a \" no-fly zone \" over the white house has long existed , the sfra airspace was developed to protect the washington area further after the 9/11 terrorist attacks . the size of the sfra airspace is designed to be large enough to give our defense forces enough time to determine if a threat exists from an aircraft entering it , an opportunity to identify the threat , and if necessary , to divert or eliminate it . an airspeed restriction begins at a 60-mile radius from the center of reagan national airport . at the 30-mile radius , all aircraft must file a flight plan that identifies itself to air traffic control via a specific four-digit transponder code ( a transponder is an electronic communication device that identifies a specific airplane on an air traffic controller 's display screen to indicate authorization for the flight ) . aircraft must enter the sfra through specific flight \" gates \" that are displayed on a standard aviation map . aircraft on instrument flight rule flight plans , which include all airline operations , are not required to comply with sfra restrictions . air traffic control assumes the responsibility for the appropriate routing . as a matter of standard procedure , flights using an instrument flight rule flight plan have specific clearances with specific transponder codes , so the authorization for transit through the sfra airspace is already built into the system . why do i carry the certificate as an airline pilot ? i have had occasion to fly my own little airplane through the airspace on a visual flight rule flight plan . pilot who landed gyrocopter blogged about why noncompliance with the airspace requirements , or worse , no communication at all , carries some serious federal penalties , which could include the suspension or revocation of your pilot license . being at the wrong end of an f-16 missile is also a possible penalty . so how does a flying machine that looks like a sophisticated lawn chair with helicopter blades invade such highly restricted airspace , as happened wednesday , when a postal carrier from florida landed a single-person aircraft on capitol grounds ? well , i 'm making an assumption based on the video footage , but it appears that this aircraft is classified by the faa as a gyrocopter . a gyrocopter can not quite launch straight up into the air in the manner of a typical helicopter ; it requires a short ground run for takeoff . and most gyrocopters are kit-built aircraft . it also appears that this particular gyrocopter may weigh just under 255 pounds , which classifies it as an ultralight aircraft in faa parlance . below that weight , a license for the pilot or a license for the aircraft is not required . in addition , to remain in the classification , the maximum designed airspeed ca n't exceed 55 knots . lawmaker looking into gyrocopter landing as pilot goes to court a facility tracking the movement of this particular gyrocopter on radar would witness a speed probably attainable by the average canadian goose . and the radar reflection on a piece of machinery of that diminutive size is most likely very limited . if it was actually tracked on a radar screen , the target may have appeared to be a flock of birds . how much damage could this aircraft have inflicted had it been intended for nefarious purposes ? well , if it had been crashed into a building , i feel confident that the building would have been triumphant . if the intent had been to carry some sort of destructive device , the weapon would have had to be relatively small . the engine is not designed to carry more than one pilot . and lack of carry-on space is a definite issue . not that a review of airspace security measures is n't in order , but i would n't be concerned that this event will become the next threat epidemic . as an airline pilot , i can say i am relatively confident that our nation 's capital is secure from gyrocopter attacks orchestrated by misguided lunatics .\n",

            "( cnn ) according to an outside review by columbia journalism school professors , \" ( a ) n institutional failure at rolling stone resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the university of virginia . \" the columbia team concluded that \" the failure encompassed reporting , editing , editorial supervision and fact-checking . \" hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication . the magazine 's managing editor , will dana , wrote , \" we would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout , including members of the phi kappa psi fraternity and uva administrators and students . \" brian stelter : fraternity to ` pursue all available legal action ' can uva , phi kappa psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation ? the virginia supreme court said in jordan v. kollman that \" the elements of libel are ( 1 ) publication of ( 2 ) an actionable statement with ( 3 ) the requisite intent . \" \" actionable \" means the statement must be both false and defamatory . of course , the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the first amendment to the united states constitution , but also the virginia constitution . true statements can not be defamatory . neither can pure statements of opinion , because they theoretically can not be either true or false . but the rolling stone article certainly purported to be fact , and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers \" true . \" the individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . a private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . the private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . at first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? the columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . but that 's only half the battle . there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . the identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . first , let 's eliminate uva . the university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . the supreme court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : the government can not sue for defamation . there is no such cause of action in american jurisprudence . now the fraternities , starting with phi kappa psi . a fraternity is not an individual , but a group . a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were \" of or concerning \" the plaintiff . it sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . when the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is \" concerning \" the individual -- and groups generally can not sue . for example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . like all rules , however , there are exceptions . if the defamatory language is about \" a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue . \" if i said , \" the 1980 philadelphia phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals \" ( they were n't ) , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if i said that -- which i did n't . phi kappa psi would likely argue that the \" small group \" exception fits it perfectly : even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . on the other hand , rolling stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid ( after all , the membership changes somewhat every year ) , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . that 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . so if your aunt edna calls you a loser on twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . and since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on facebook live in their moms ' basements and are \" between jobs , \" these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . the uva situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case . the university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .\n",

            "a dog breeder and her husband have been jailed for animal cruelty after their animals were found in the ` worst conditions ever seen ' . margaret and gary mazan from bradford , west yorkshire , had their 14 red setters seized by rspca inspectors after the animals were discovered in filthy cages in a garden shed . the court heard how the animals had matted fur , were dehydrated and had not been provided with a suitable diet . cruel : margaret mazan ( pictured ) and her husband gary were found guilty of animal cruelty after their 14 red setters were found in appalling conditions sentenced : margaret ( left ) and gary mazan ( right ) were jailed for 26 weeks and given a lifetime ban from owning or keeping pets , which they can not appeal for 25 years three of the fully grown dogs were found by inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed . magistrates heard the couple caused unnecessary suffering to some of the dogs by failing to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails . mrs mazan , 53 , who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years , chose not to give evidence at bradford and keighley magistrates ' court during the two-day trial . her husband gary , 51 , who is a long-distance lorry driver , claimed it was mrs mazan who had sole responsibility for the dogs . crammed : the animals were found with matted fur and inside cramped , filthy cages inside a garden shed seized : rspca inspectors discovered the animals in some of the ` worst conditions ' they had ever seen owner : mrs mazan , who was said to have shown and bred setters for more than 10 years , chose not to give evidence at bradford and keighley magistrates ' court during the two-day trial the animals had been kept at the family 's home since they moved from leeds to bradford in february 2013 . a month after the move the rspca served a warning notice due to the conditions the dogs were being kept in , which had been adhered to by the time they visited again in april 2013 . but concerns over the welfare of the animals were raised by a dog warden after they were refused access to the property and called the rspca . emma ellis , an rspca inspector for bradford who attended the scene and helped to seize the animals , said it was the worst conditions she has seen in her 12 years as an inspector . she said : ` to see 12 dogs living in a small shed , with three fully grown setters living in a puppy cage is horrific . ` they could not sit down or turn around and there fur was matted , covered in urine and faeces . ` when the shed was opened , the smell literally hit you and it was a small like i had never experienced before . i still recall the smell every time i see the photos . caged : the animals had been kept at the bradford home since the family moved from leeds in february 2013 matted : the couple were said to have caused unnecessary suffering to the dogs as they failed to seek veterinary care for their eyes and injuries to their tails ( pictured ) ` to keep animals in these conditions is unacceptable for anyone , let a alone a dog breeder . ' the animals are now currently under the care of the rspca , after the charity demanded ownership of all the mazans ' pets , including an additional dog , called clever . the dog , which belonged to the family 's daughter who was away at university , had been chipped in mrs mazan 's name and magistrates decided to transfer custody of the animal , alongside the other 14 dogs , to the rspca . dingle clark , prosecuting on behalf of the rspca , told the court that boarding costs for the dogs since they were seized had reached # 48,000 , with an additional # 7,000 in vets fees . filthy : three of the fully grown dogs were found by rspca inspectors crammed in puppy cages and the majority were kept in a squalid garden shed . all animals are now in the charity 's care sentencing the pair to 26 weeks in jail , allie coward , chairman of the bench , said : ` we have considered all the evidence , and this was the most heinous act of cruelty against defenceless animals we have ever seen . ' an immediate appeal against the sentence was made and a request for bail ahead of any appeal hearing at the crown court , but the application for bail was denied by the court . the pair were also given a lifetime ban against owning or keeping any animal , and told they can not appeal against the order for at least 25 years .\n",

            "( cnn ) after two days of deliberation , jurors found dzhokhar tsarnaev guilty on all counts in the boston marathon bombing . the verdict is n't surprising . what might be , however , is the answer to how we prevent this kind of violence from happening again . because there could be other more young men just like him , which means the lessons we take from boston will affect whether we can keep america and americans safer . today , nearly 1 out of 4 people in the world are muslim . by 2050 , pew reports , that will be some 1 out of 3 . well , i 'll quote the all-caps headline reprinted by the drudge report : \" muslims to outnumber christians ! \" many americans read such numbers and worry : will this mean more dzhokhar tsarnaevs ? but that 's only if you believe islam causes extremism , which many have argued . and that 's wrong , of course . on the other hand , there are people who claim islam has nothing to do with terrorism . which is true -- and false . sure , the islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in islam 's name . understanding what leads young muslims like dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization . at any given moment in the middle east , we have little idea who 's going to attack whom next , who 's on whom 's side , how this is going to end , or what anyone 's even fighting over anymore . this bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better . but it will get better . to understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes muslims contrary to common belief , muslims are n't unusually predisposed to violence . radical islam , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity . islam is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community . and what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? some muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions ( the road to hell , after all ) . consider : the tragedy of modern islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies . before my time , the brutal soviet invasion of afghanistan horrified many muslims . when i was in high school , bosnia occupied all our attention . there was of course russia 's brutal war on the chechen people -- dzhokhar shares his name with a recent chechen patriot -- and israel 's ongoing occupation of the palestinian territories . and the blows against muslims do n't end there . there was serbia 's war on kosovo , another war in chechnya , the invasion of iraq , oppression in myanmar , civil strife in syria , the colonization of east turkestan , massacres of muslims in the central african republic , wars on a besieged gaza and west bank still under israeli rule . imagine how this looks to a restless young muslim . countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it . extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : take up arms -- and kill . in her new book , \" heretic : why islam needs a reformation now \" , ayaan hirsi ali argues that extremism is n't caused by political circumstances , but by islam itself . to fight extremism , we do n't need to reform islam . we need to show young muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to . rather than help muslims , it 's harming them . when i was a teenager , our massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from bosnia that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on muslims , all because of their faith . the mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine . promises were made to provide more , and regularly . but we all knew that was n't enough . as we left the mosque , my peers and i were disgruntled and confused . our teachers could 've told us : go and fight . defend your muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege . or they could 've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably . neither answer would have satisfied . fortunately for us , they offered us a third way . they showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done . a more engaged american muslim community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world . we saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored . thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young muslim population is increasingly comfortable with , more muslims can and will see this , too . radicalism will be done in by fellow muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it . our national conversation about islam is focused on the wrong issues . does islam need a reformation ? what in islam causes violence ? we would do a lot better if we accepted that muslims the world over have real grievances -- dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these . we need to show the young dzhokhars that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help . to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young muslims : \" do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? \" because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse . the caliph wears no clothes . it 's the reason why increasing numbers of muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing . how to prevent future such acts by young muslims ? many equate terror with islam . not true , but we should grasp what causes radicalization they must be shown other way to help\n",

            "traitor edward snowden has revealed he did not read all the top-secret intelligence documents he leaked -- a move which put lives at risk from terrorists . in a television interview the fugitive squirmed as he admitted only ` evaluating ' the files stolen from gchq and the us national security agency . the former us spy also acknowledged there had been a ` f *** - up ' when newspapers that were handed the classified material failed to redact sensitive details exposing operations against al qaeda . last week tonight host john oliver flew to moscow to grill edward snowden about the leaking of ` harmful ' documents and asks him to explain why he did it but in an outburst of arrogance , snowden said such potentially catastrophic blunders were a ` fundamental ' price of liberty . the 31-year-old stunned the world in june 2013 -- less than a month after the murder of lee rigby by islamic extremists -- when he broke cover as the civilian cia worker who stole classified documents . he leaked information about attempts by spying agencies including gchq and the nsa to view citizens ' private information , claiming internet history , emails , text messages , calls and passwords were harvested . but security chiefs have warned that secret techniques , revealed by snowden 's leaks to the guardian newspaper , have made it easier for terrorists and organised criminals to avoid detection . last month , home secretary theresa may attacked the harm done by the traitor -- now one of the world 's most wanted men . terror experts said lives were being lost because he had hampered security service operations . they warned that extremists had altered their tactics after he leaked details from intelligence agencies -- with fatal results . in sunday night 's interview with british tv host john oliver , for us channel hbo , snowden pointedly avoided saying he had read every document he handed over to journalists . at one point the british comedian asks snowden whether he had read all of the documents he sent to journalists . the whistleblower said he had an ` understanding ' of their content he would only say : ` i 've evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive . ' pressed , he added : ` i do understand what i turned over . ' but he acknowledged ` recognising the concern ' over whether he knew enough about the contents of the files or the abilities of reporters to protect classified details . snowden admitted there had been a ` f *** - up ' with the way in which some of the information about the nsa and gchq , britain 's intelligence agency , had been released . last year , the new york times published a slide containing the name of the nsa employee who prepared it . the target of the surveillance was also identified as al qaeda in mosul , iraq . snowden said such details should have been removed and , in a feeble attempt to defend his actions , added : ` in journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made . this is a fundamental concept of liberty . ' unconvinced , mr oliver replied : ` you 're giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there ... we 're not even talking about bad faith , we 're talking about incompetence . ' oliver tries to get snowden to explain the leak in the context of nude pictures . the ex-cia systems administrator claims the government can see most of the pictures you share it is one of the few occasions in which snowden has been put on the spot over his treachery as he normally speaks only to left-wing media who have published his leaks . lord west , a former first sea lord and security minister , said : ` since the revelations of the traitor snowden , terrorist groups have changed how they communicate and talk to each other . ` his actions have made us all less safe . no doubt people will die who would not have died had he not been so irresponsible . ' robin simcox , of the henry jackson society security think-tank , said : ` this is exactly the danger that those who believe snowden 's actions were hugely irresponsible -- and potentially fatal -- warned of . ` this interview seemed to show how little snowden had thought about the potentially deadly consequences . snowden stole a huge amount of sensitive documents and as a result terrorists and other serious criminals have adapted their methods accordingly . ' snowden handed an estimated 200,000 of the 1.7 million stolen classified documents to journalists . in june 2013 , he told the guardian : ` i carefully evaluated every single document i disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest . ' this is a transcript of snowden 's interview : john oliver : how many of those documents have you actually read ? edward snowden : i 've evaluated all of the documents that are in the archive . oliver : you 've read every single one ? snowden : i do understand what i turned over . ` these things happen ' : edward snowden , above , during his television interview oliver : there 's a difference between understanding what 's in the documents and reading what 's in the documents . snowden : i recognize the concern . oliver ( cuts in sarcastically ) : right , because when you 're handing over thousands of nsa documents , the last thing you want to do is read them . snowden : i think it 's fair to be concerned -- did this person do enough , were they careful enough ? oliver ( cuts in ) : especially when you 're handling material like we know you 're handling . snowden : in my defence i 'm not handling anything any more . that 's been passed to the journalists and they 're using extraordinary security measures to make sure this is being reported in the most responsible way . asking the questions : john oliver oliver : but those are journalists with a lower technical skill set than you . snowden : that 's true but they do understand like you and i do just how important it is to get this right . oliver : the new york times took a slide , it did n't redact it properly and in the end it was possible to see that something was being used in mosul on al qaeda . snowden : that is a problem . oliver : well , that 's a **** - up . snowden : it is a **** - up and these things do happen in reporting . in journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made . this is a fundamental concept of liberty . oliver : right , but you have to own that then . you 're giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there . snowden : yes , if people act in bad faith . oliver ( cuts in ) : we 're not even talking about bad faith , we 're talking about incompetence . snowden : we are , but you will never be completely free from risk if you 're free . the only time you can be free from risk is when you 're in prison . he added : ` there are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that i did n't turn over , because harming people is n't my goal . ' a report by the henry jackson society last month revealed terror suspects were using human couriers instead of email and phones following the leaks by snowden . daily operations of british spies have been damaged , with islamic state seizing on the information -- making it harder to track down its operatives . al qaeda militants are known to have changed communication methods to avoid detection , and have produced a video advising fellow extremists on the matter . gchq has lost track of some of britain 's most dangerous criminals because of the way snowden exposed its operations . officials had to stop monitoring drug gangs , paedophiles , human traffickers and money launderers . the agency has also been forced to tone down or abandon surveillance amid fears the tactics are too easy to spot and could force criminals to fall off the radar . mrs may told the commons home affairs committee that the leaks ` did cause damage ' , adding : ` it has had an impact on the ability of our agencies to do the work they need to do . ' snowden , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in hawaii , tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy files in one of the biggest leaks in us history . he claims he had to act because the us government 's policies were a ` threat to democracy ' . he fled to hong kong , then russia , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location . a guardian spokesman said the newspaper had ` nothing to add ' in response to snowden saying he had ` evaluated ' the documents and whether this had put people at risk . how the guardian changed headline to protect its favourite ` whistleblower ' the left-wing guardian newspaper climbed into bed with edward snowden when he leaked the top-secret intelligence documents , publishing a string of damaging stories . and yesterday it was still giving the so-called whistleblower an easy ride when reporting on his clash with tv host john oliver on his us show last week tonight . the initial story on the guardian website focused on the sensational revelation that snowden had apparently not read all the documents . the headline stated : ` edward snowden tells john oliver he did not read all leaked nsa material . ' it added : ` the whistleblower admits his actions carried dangers . ' but within hours it had toned down the headline so it focused less on his irresponsibility and incompetence . it was changed to : ` john oliver presses edward snowden on whether he read all leaked nsa material . ' the sub-heading was amended , to the softer : ` hbo host posts uncomfortable questions to nsa whistleblower in interview in moscow . ' a guardian spokesman said the headline was changed because ` an earlier version stated that edward snowden admitted he had not read all the nsa documents he leaked . in fact he did not answer that question ' . the first guardian website story ... and the later toned down version\n",

' i should n't need to remind you that animals such as this have attacked members of your community . while not holding you responsible for that , you have knowingly involved yourself in an industry that perpetuates cruelty and criminality in relation to animals . ` the intention of fighting to the death shows a failure to take proper responsibility of these animals . i am satisfied that his took place over an extended period of time . ` each of you has an unhealthy interest . you have invested a significant amount of finances and attempted - especially darren wheatcroft - to make money out of it , involving others and travelling abroad to acquire the animals . you were involved in criminality .

' an rspca spokesman added : ` after fights many dogs are left with horrific injuries and rather than taking them to a vet , dog fighters will perform crude surgeries without anesthetic . often using staple guns or super glue to close up wounds . ` most dogs used for fighting will ultimately either be killed in the ring , die as a result of their injuries or in some cases be killed by their owners .

' i was left on the floor after the robbery and could n't get myself up for nearly ten minutes due to the pain and shock . due to my age i found it very difficult to get up . ` i 'm independently minded and determined not to allow this to change how i live or where or when i go out .

' outlining the attack , he added : ` mr evans is returning to his block of flats with his shopping . ` the defendant follows him in behind him . mr evans recalls it as being about visiting a friend inside the block of flats and helping him with his shopping . in a victim impact statement , mr evans , pictured , told the court that he wanted his attacker locked up for a long time to protect the public ` mr evans then waits for a lift . the defendant returns , accosts him , takes mr evans ' wallet from him causing mr evans to fall to the floor where he is unable to rise from for some time .

' dressed in a blue hoodie and black trousers , the scruffily bearded bygraves , of no fixed address , showed no emotion as he was taken away . the judge also praised mr evans and his comments in his victim impact statement . he added : ` this was a 92 year-old man going about his business . ` it was a remarkable victim impact statement . it is commendable , it shows a man of independence and maturity and understanding and appreciation .

' after explaining to jurors that match-fixers chann sankaran and krishna ganeshan were found guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery at a previous trial , mr mather alleged that swaibu was one of the players they had tried to corrupt . sankaran and ganeshan , both from the far east , were at the centre of the conspiracy , the court heard , having travelled to britain with the specific purpose of fixing matches . defendant moses swaibu ( right ) on the ball during an fa cup match between lincoln and bolton in 2010 the crown alleges that the plot - which aimed to profit from rigged bets - targeted the lower leagues because of the high level of scrutiny surrounding the premier league . swaibu played at a semi-professional level between 2009 and 2014 , including stints with london-based sutton fc and brighton club whitehawk . jurors were also given details of facey 's career , which included a spell at lincoln city in which he earned around # 65,000 during the 2010/11 season . describing facey 's alleged role in the conspiracy , mr mather added : ` he was a middleman , a fixer . he was somebody who cast his net around to find players who might be willing to take part in match-fixing . ' by the time of the alleged conspiracy in november 2013 , mr mather told the court , facey was earning considerably less than previously . ` that may well have been his motivation , the prosecution say , for what took place , ' mr mather said of facey 's reduced income . facey ( top ) in action for west brom during a match against norwich city in march 2004 informing jurors that another footballer , former whitehawk fc defender michael boateng , was also found guilty at a previous trial , mr mather said there was no doubt that an agreement to fix lower league matches occurred . ` this case is not about whether this scheme existed , ' the prosecutor told the jury . ` the issue for you to decide is whether you are sure that firstly , delroy facey , and secondly moses swaibu , was a part of that agreement . ` this case is focused on them and what they did , and why they did it . ' facey , from woodhouse hill , huddersfield , and 25-year-old swaibu , of tooley street , bermondsey , south london , deny conspiring together with others to commit bribery between november 1 and 27 , 2013 . mr mather said betting on football was not confined to the premier league and extended from the very top of the sport down to semi-professional leagues . lower league games in the football conference had been targeted , mr mather claimed , partly because highly-paid professionals would have to be offered ` astronomical ' sums to even think about becoming involved in corruption . huddersfield 's facey ( left ) vies with brentford 's michael dobson during an old second division match in 2002 the conspiracy came to the attention of the national crime agency after initial inquiries by a private investigator who wanted to expose match-fixing led to the identification of sankaran . a national newspaper then became involved , the court was told , and sankaran arrived in the uk in november 2013 . during a meeting with an undercover investigator on november 16 , sankaran is alleged to have made unsuccessful attempts to contact footballers and made reference to an agent named delroy who used to play for bolton . at that point , the court heard , the national crime agency took over the investigation , deploying a covert officer to gather evidence . the officer met sankaran five days later and mobile phones belonging to the defendants , including facey , were subsequently seized . mr mather will continue his opening speech to the jury on tuesday . sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article .\n",

' during the initial stage of his trial , prosecutors portrayed him as an extremist who wanted to ` punish america ' for military campaigns in muslim-dominated countries . the teen followed a blueprint from al qaeda 's inspire magazine to build the homemade pressure-cooker bombs that ripped through crowds of spectators , volunteers and athletes on april 15 , 2013 . bruck urged the jury to sentence the defendant to life in prison without the possibility of ever being released for his crimes . a chilling photo was revealed last week at the boston bombing trial showing the aftermath of the blasts on boylston street ` his legal case will be over for good , and no martyrdom , just years and years of punishment , ' the lawyer said . ` all the while , society is protected . ' bruck told the court that tsarnaev would be sent to a supermax prison in the colorado mountains , adding that he would have no privacy , be under a video camera 24 hours a day . he would be allowed no interviews , there would be no autobiography and no messages relayed , the attorney added . bruck focused heavily on tsarnaev 's brother , tamerlan , who died after a gunfight with police four days after the bombing , saying he led the plot and provided the ` fuel ' to drive the plan . he said tamerlan was ` consumed by jihad ' and had ` power ' over dzhokhar , who admired his older brother . bruck contrasted tamerlan with dzhokhar , saying tamerlan was loud and aggressive , got into fights , failed at everything he did and never held a steady job , while dzhokhar was a good student in high school , was loved by his teachers there , had many friends and never got in a fight . ` he was a good kid , ' the lawyer said . but he said tsarnaev started going downhill in college . one of the first defense witnesses to testify in the penalty phase described an incident at a mosque when tamerlan became angry and interrupted prayer services . imam loay assaf testified on monday that he got very angry during one service in 2013 when assaf praised martin luther king jr and compared him to the prophet mohammad . assaf says tamerlan interrupted the service , shouting at him and calling him a ` hypocrite ' . prosecutors have portrayed tsarnaev as an unrepentant killer who gave the finger to the security camera in his jail cell three months after his arrest . the startling photo and video were shown to the jury last week . bruck downplayed the gesture , saying tsarnaev was ` acting like an immature 19-year-old ' . defense attorney , judith clarke , had opened the trial with the blunt admission ` it was him , ' tsarnaev , who committed all the crimes he was charged with . phase by arguing that , when it came to planning the attack and building the bombs , ` tamerlan did that . ' defense attorneys timothy watkins , left , and david bruck arrive at federal court on monday during the penalty phase of the federal trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev , who was convicted of the boston marathon bombings that killed three and injured 260 people in april 2013 in this courtroom sketch , bombing survivor marc fucarile , right , was depicted on the witness stand on friday during the penalty phase where he stared down tsarnaev . fucarile said he has had more than 60 surgeries , and it is still unclear whether his left leg can be saved in a sharp contrast to the last phase of the trial , when the defense took just two days to call four witnesses , the court has scheduled about two weeks ' worth of testimony as tsarnaev 's lawyers make the case to spare his life . few details are known about who the defense lawyers will call to testify as all witness lists in this trial have been filed under on thursday , local media reported that some members of tsarnaev 's family arrived in boston . it is not clear exactly which members of his family traveled to boston or if they will testify or simply observe the another unanswered question is whether tsarnaev will speak he has been a quiet presence during the trial , offering no signs of emotion as the jury heard sometimes tearful testimony from survivors and viewed graphic , disturbing images of the bombs ' detonation and aftermath . eight-year-old martin richard , chinese exchange student lu lingzi , 23 , and restaurant manager krystle campbell , 29 , died in the the tsarnaev brothers shot dead massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier three days later .\n",

            "oklahoma introduced a law allowing it to use nitrogen gas to kill death row prisoners if lethal injections are n't available . governor mary fallin signed into law a bill approving nitrogen as an alternative method of death , giving oklahoma four different ways to enact its death penalty . the method , which involves pumping a chamber full of nitrogen and leaving a prisoner 's body to die from lack of oxygen , has been touted as ` foolproof ' by supporters , in the wake of the embarrassingly botched lethal injections . gas chamber : the state of oklahoma has legalized killing death row in-mates with nitrogen . this 1999 file photo shows an arizona correctional officer explaining his state 's execution method executions in the state are currently on hold while the supreme court ponders whether the three-drug mix now favored by oklahoma is constitutional . the pause follows an infamous execution last ear , which saw officials struggle to administer a the poison to an inmate , who writhed on the gurney in pain for some 43 minutes before finally dying . nitrogen - which has never been used to execute humans before - is now the state 's second choice . the new bill , effective from november 2015 , moves the electric chair back from second preference to third , while firing squad becomes a distant fourth choice if all other methods are unavailable . proponents tout that nitrogen killings will be ` fast and painless ' for inmates - and also say the method is ` foolproof ' as it requires no medical expertise or complex procedures . in a statement issued as the bill was signed , fallin , a republican , said : ` oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous . ' i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty . the bill i signed today gives the state of oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard . ' the bill authored by republican rep. mike christian and republican sen. anthony sykes had passed the state house on an 85-10 vote and cleared the senate on a 41-0 vote . christian , a former highway patrol trooper , said : ` the process is fast and painless - it 's foolproof . ' opponents say there 's no way to know whether the method is painless and effective . ` it just has n't been tried , so we do n't know , ' said rep. emily virgin , a democrat from norman who opposes the death penalty . the changes come after a botched execution last year in which oklahoma was using a new sedative as the first in a three-drug combination . state officials tried to halt the lethal injection after the inmate writhed on the gurney and moaned . he died 43 minutes after the process began . adam leathers , spokesman for the oklahoma coalition to abolish the death penalty , released a statement blasting the new law . ` this is not only a grotesque waste of resources but indicative of a corrupt value system , ' he said . ` it is sad to know that our state 's collective bloodlust is so unabated that our leadership feels the need to spend resources to put a back up system into place so state sponsored murder can go on uninterrupted . ' the problematic execution was blamed on a poorly placed intravenous line and prompted a lawsuit from oklahoma death row inmates , who argue that the state 's new drug combination presents a serious risk of pain and suffering . the u.s. supreme court is scheduled to hear arguments later this month . the lack of readily-available lethal injection drugs - and problems with stocks the states do have - has vexed several other states . utah brought back the firing squad earlier this year in response to a drugs shortage , while tennessee reinstated the electric chair .\n",

            "a second utah student has filed a lawsuit against the davis county school district for hiring an english teacher who then allegedly went on to have sex with him and two other boys . disgraced davis high school educator brianne altice , 35 , was ordered last month to stand trial on 14 felony charges , including rape , sodomy , sexual abuse and sex with a minor , in connection to her suspected affairs with three students . in mid-march , one of the alleged victims brought a $ 647,000 lawsuit against the utah school district accusing officials of negligence for failing to fire the ` flirtatious ' teacher before she started a sexual relationship with him . more legal trouble : two students have now filed lawsuits against the davis county school district in utah accusing officials of failing to fire english teacher brianne altice , pictured in court in january , who is accused of having six with three boys the latest lawsuit , filed last week , describes how altice began flirting with the student , then 16 , and other boys in her class , reported the salt lake tribune . court documents detail how at times , the students skipped other classes and spent entire days with altice , sent her text messages and made explicit comments to her . on her part , the 35-year-old altice confided in her teenage admirers about her martial problems . according to the complaint , the relationship between the woman and the boys in her class eventually turned physical . court documents state that altice 's dalliances were an open secret at davis high , where the running joke among students was : ` who is ms altice sleeping with now ? ' similarly to the first lawsuit , the new complaint alleges that the school district was aware of brianne altice 's inappropriate behavior but failed to take action against her . she allegedly had sex with the third student while she was out on bail for charges relating to the first two students . her bail was then revoked and she remains behind bars . not happy : altice is pictured in court in february after her motion to drop one of the charges against her was denied the student who brought the initial lawsuit in march accused the district of being negligent when it hired altice and says it is responsible for the damage she inflicted on him . he claimed they started a relationship in early 2013 after they flirted during class and texted and ultimately started kissing and having sex . he stated that the school district had reprimanded altice after seeing photos of her having inappropriate contact with students but she was not fired , the tribune reported . school district spokesman chris williams said at the time he was unaware of the lawsuit . despite the claims against her , one of her alleged victims has previously testified that the charges against altice are ` ridiculous ' and ` she does n't deserve to be here ' . in trouble : altice , pictured at a hearing in february 2014 , allegedly had sex with the boys from early 2013 he told the court he had sex with altice once prior to october 2013 - when she was initially arrested - and then three more times after that in december , while she was out on bail . in august 2014 , a second student came forward to say he had also had a physical relationship with the former davis high english teacher , whose marriage fell apart in the aftermath of the scandal . altice 's attorney has said his client denies any romantic involvement with the three students . ` it is her defense that they did not happen at all , ' he wrote in a motion . ` that she never engaged in any inappropriate contact with either of her students . ' but prosecutors said the teacher acknowledged to investigators that she had engaged in sex with a 16-year-old boy on two occasions . the teen was allegedly able to accurately describe the layout of altice 's home to detectives as well as tattoos on her body . one of her victims has accused the school district of failing to fire the english teacher , left , even though it knew she had acted inappropriately with students . she was first taken into custody in 2013 brass asked the judge to not allow those statements at her trial , arguing that she was intimidated by the eight to 10 male officers who came to her home in october 2013 to interview her . brass argued that the officers would not let her care for children , call an attorney or use the restroom for nearly four hours as they questioned her . ` her statements were coerced and involuntary and were taken in violation of her so-called miranda rights , ' brass wrote in court papers . ` the evidence she provided was the product of that tainted statement . ' in february , she requested to drop one of the charges , claiming she had not been in a position of authority when she was accused of having sex with one of the boys . but a judge denied the motion . altice would be tried separately in each student 's case -- meaning she 'll get three different trials .\n",

            "this is the brilliant young honors student who was brutalized by mad men star jon hamm in a sadistic fraternity hazing ritual . seen here for the first time , mark allen sanders was beaten with a paddle , dragged around a room by his genitals and had his pants set on fire . golden globe winner hamm was one of seven sigma nu brothers who tormented and humiliated sanders when he was a young pledge at the university of texas at austin . the young man was hit so hard during the warped 1990 initiation that he suffered a fractured spine and nearly lost a kidney . hazing hell : today mark sanders is a doctor and lawyer in fort worth texas . but after he graduated high school in 1988 he entered the university of texas at austin and pledged the sigma nu fraternity . that 's when he met john hamm and his hazing hell began football hero : jon hamm the year he graduated from john burroughs school in ladue , missouri and one year before his admission to university of texas at austin partners : jon hamm and jennifer westfeldt attended the \" girls \" season four series premiere after party at the museum of natural history on january 5 , 2015 in new york city . sanders subsequently withdrew from the university and sought counselling to cope with the shameful episode which resulted in a police inquiry and the fraternity chapter being disbanded . hamm , a sophomore , was identified as a ringleader and arrested in 1993 , long before he became one of america 's most recognizable actors playing boozy advertising exec don draper . an assault charge was dismissed , however , and he completed a period of probation instead of receiving a conviction for hazing . our exclusive photos show sanders in his senior year at richland high school in north richland hills , texas where he excelled in his studies , played for the basketball team and was treasurer of the school council . despite his ordeal at ut he was able to resume his education at texas christian university , before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine . the 45-year-old lives now with his wife anada , 41 , and their two children in fort worth , where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury . he has declined to speak publicly about his ordeal but the harrowing details are laid bare in court documents dating back more than two decades . in a 1991 interview transcript obtained by daily mail online , sanders tells investigators with the travis county 's attorney 's office how he suffered ` repeated beatings and assaults ' at the hands of sigma nu ` actives ' . he also alleged that he and his fellow pledges were subjected to ` repeated confinements ' in a series of tiny compartments carved into the frat building 's foundations - including ` the pit ' , ` the hole ' and ` the grave ' . sanders listed hamm as one of his chief tormentors , recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the ` bulls *** list ' when sanders forgot the last of hamm 's nicknames , which included mc hammer and young bobby , he recalled how hamm got \" mad , i mean really mad ' sanders told officials the worst of the hazing happened in the early hours of november 10 , 1990 when he was summoned to the house and warned by hamm : ` it 's going to be a long night . ' the junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity . mark sanders in his 1988 high school yearbook from richland high school in north richland hills he listed hamm as one of his chief tormentors , recalling how the future star ordered him to recite a six-page list of phrases pledges are told to memorize called the ` bulls *** list ' . when he forgot the last of hamm 's nicknames , which included mc hammer and young bobby , he recalled how hamm got \" mad , i mean really mad ' . hamm and his frat cohorts ' retribution was to spank sanders repeatedly with a paddle . ` i 'm hurting bad , i mean being hit right where the kidney is , it 's killing me , ' sanders told his interviewers . hamm and another fraternity member then lifted sanders up by his underwear , pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion . ' i do n't know how far underwear stretches , i do n't know how far i was off the ground , ' he recalled . ' i was hurting really bad and i remember i was looking up at the ceiling and i was gritting my teeth and squinting my eyes ... it was sawing and it was hurting . ' sanders told investigators how hamm then led him to ` the pit ' where he ordered him to do press-ups and pushed his face into the ground . the distraught pledge felt someone , possibly hamm , standing on his back . hamm is then supposed to have set fire to sanders ' pants and refused to let him pat the flames down , instead making him blow them out . finally he was led upstairs to the ` party room ' when hamm hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his testicles and pulled him around the room ` for at least a minute ' . suave don draper has had to his own dark past on the hit show mad men . but for jon hamm , ` the hazing incident was an isolated incident , ' said a friend despite his ordeal , sanders was able to resume his education at texas christian university , before going to further institutions to study both law and medicine . the 45-year-old lives now with his wife in fort worth , where he works both as a doctor and an attorney specializing in medical malpractice and personal injury in the wake of the hazing , sanders fled to a friend 's room to escape further brutality before eventually showing his bruises to fellow students . he later claimed to have suffered nerve damage to his ribs , kidney spasms and a lineal spinal fracture sanders ' horrified mother margaret reported it to ut authorities , triggering a police investigation and prompting the fraternity to permanently close its ut chapter . university records show hamm , now aged 44 , left the college at the end of the semester without a degree and returned to his hometown in missouri . sanders later launched a lawsuit against sigma nu seeking ` unspecified actual and exemplary damages for willful and wanton misconduct ' . it was dismissed with the agreement of both parties , however , in 1993 , possibly signalling that an out-of-court settlement had been reached . that same year hamm was arrested by the austin police department but court documents show that in 1995 he received deferred adjudication , allowing him to avoid a criminal conviction by serving a period of probation . his hazing shame went unreported for two decades until star magazine broke the story last week in the midst of the final mad men season airing on amc . hamm is yet to comment but a friend told star : ` the hazing incident was an isolated incident in jon 's life . since then , he 's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person . ' shame : the allegedly assault saw hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to the pledge and beat him with a paddle early career : jon hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show the big date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident three sigma nu members also pleaded no contest to charges of hazing , a misdemeanor , and were ordered to serve 15 to 30 days in jail . they were subsequently allowed to complete a community service or work-release program instead . another member was convicted of a lesser hazing violation and fined $ 500 . sander 's attorney , bill whitehurst , did not return calls asking for comment . a warrant was issued for hamm 's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed . he returned home to live with his family in missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career . a friend told star that although shocking , ` the hazing incident was an isolated incident in jon 's life . since then , he 's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person .

            "disgraced former mayor lutfur rahman ( pictured ) is said to have played the race card to silence opponents - and his deputy today reiterated claims there is deep seated racism in the borough of tower hamlets , in east london a deputy of disgraced former mayor lutfur rahman yesterday appeared to blame the vote-rigging scandal on ` institutional racism ' . oliur rahman , who took over from the deposed leader yesterday , insisted there was deep-rooted racism within the east london borough of tower hamlets . his comment was at odds with a devastating legal ruling that condemned his predecessor for bribery and ballot fraud and found he had repeatedly ` played the race card ' to silence critics . the two men -- who are not related -- are both members of the tower hamlets first party . political opponents said they were playing the same ` cracked record ' by seeking to blame racism and islamophobia for their problems . oliur rahman told the bbc : ` if people say there is no racism in tower hamlets , then they are very much mistaken because there is institutional racism . ` if people want to turn a blind eye to the racism then that 's their decision but they are very much mistaken if they turn round and say there is no racism in tower hamlets , and that people are not judged because of their skin colour and their religion . ' on thursday , electoral judge richard mawrey qc found that lutfur rahman , 49 , and his cronies had rigged the 2014 mayoral ballot by creating an army of ` ghost voters ' , forging postal votes , bribing muslim voters and using religious intimidation against them and branding opponents as racists . he found that all the councillors from the tower hamlets first party were elected corruptly . oliur rahman , 34 , a former councillor for george galloway 's respect party but now a tower hamlets first councillor , emailed his fellow members yesterday to declare himself acting mayor until new elections . he said : ` following the verdict , i have assumed the executive role within the council , until a mayoral election is held . ' peter golds , the leader of the tory group in tower hamlets , said : ` oliur rahman ought to be hanging his head in shame and apologising to the borough , but i do n't think he gets it . ` it 's ludicrous to play the race card again . they roll out this hoary old chestnut every time anything happens . the real unpleasant racism has come from the ranks of tower hamlets first . ` they 've got one cracked record , that any criticism of them is islamophobic and racist . now they 're playing it again , despite the court case . lutfur rahman , who was britain 's first elected muslim mayor , has met lawyers to discuss seeking a judicial review of the election court 's decision that he was responsible for bribery and voter fraud . supporters said he continued to deny any wrongdoing . police have been urged to launch a fresh investigation into fraud in the 2014 mayoral election , which will be re-run in june . lutfur rahman , a bangladesh-born former labour council leader , has been banned from running for public office , or even voting , for five years . four voters launched legal action against him after complaints that police and the electoral commission had failed to act . andy erlam - who launched legal action against the mayor with angela moffat and azmal hussein ( pictured left to right ) - said oliur rahman was in ` complete denial ' the group was headed by andy erlam , who stood as a councillor on an anti-corruption ticket . mr erlam said lutfur rahman 's supporters -- including oliur rahman -- were in ` complete denial ' . he added : ` they are still claiming rahman did n't do anything wrong despite a devastating judgment by a respected high court judge who spent six weeks considering the dreadful evidence . ` it makes me shudder to think they were in charge of a # 1.3 billion budget of taxpayers ' money .

' ` we 're excited to have worked with the messenger team to help people share by easily capturing moments and sharing them seamlessly within messenger , ' said austin broyles , camoji co-founder . ` we feel our integration is truly unique and innovative . ' this is the first time the world 's biggest social network has opened their messenger app to seamless integration with third parties , and this level of integration does not exist on other messenger apps . camoji had previously integrated with imessage and whatsapp , but those integrations lacked a way for recipients to easily download camoji or launch it from a conversation to reply with another gif . camoji lets you record a gif with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on messenger earlier this month facebook opened up its messenger service for developers to create apps and for consumers to communicate directly with retailers , in the social media network 's latest effort to expand its reach . the firm hopes to transform facebook 's messaging service into one that operates independently of the company 's social media network , effectively pitting it against traditional email . it even revealed it will allow smart devices such as doors and home appliances to use the platform . it comes as it faces intensifying competition from twitter and google , as well as from fast-growing messaging apps such as snapchat and wechat . facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in san francisco , for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the messenger app , which has more than 600 million users . forty different apps will be available on messenger in the coming days , allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations , facebook said . users can add text and other effects to their gifs before posting them another feature will allow consumers to use messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped . ` one of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is messenger , ' said mr zuckerberg . ` facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things , now facebook is a family of apps , ' he said . ` moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we 've made in our strategy in helping connect people .

            "( cnn ) whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . opinion : why are more women drinking ? \" it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , \" said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . \" it 's really , really scary . \" the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers ( 2 percent of residents ) and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most ( 22 percent ) . related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . still , she noted , \" there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or [ getting ] a dui . they think they have control over it . \" public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where \" blue laws \" once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . kaiser health news ( khn ) is a nonprofit national health policy news service .\n",

' coach , marcelo bielsa , right where he wants to be . bear with me , we 'll return to that thought . so obsessive has bielsa been about football for so long that it has devoured him . the man who took 7,000 videos of matches , goals , players , free-kicks , corners and penalties with him to japan as coach of argentina at the 2002 world cup ( his team were knocked out in the first round ) has reached a stage whereby no matter how well he instructs , no matter how much sagacity there is in that strange old head of his bursting to get out , the damage inflicted by his relentless intensity makes the experience pyrrhic . however , in fairness , pyrrhic does mean victory -- just at too great a cost . ergo , there has thus far been some success for the man who appointed him -- marseille president vincent labrune . initially , he reckoned : ` getting marcelo , the perfect man for our project , was a huge stroke of luck . ` i still sometimes ask myself how on earth we managed to get a coach like bielsa . it 's a bit like signing lionel messi for 12 months ... ' the sentiment lasted until the argentine savaged labrune for his work in the late summer transfer market . with some justification , it must be said . marseille manager marcelo bielsa pictured during a press conference on friday ahead of the tie marseille have not had this many points in ligue 1 at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 the two men thrashed out a truce , which has held , in public at least , and that has yielded more of the ` ready brek ' glow which can envelop the early stages of a bielsa infestation . marseille have not had this many points at this stage since winning the title back in 2010 -- only their second major trophy since 1992 . in terms of firepower and value for money , they have scored 21 and 26 goals more than the last two seasons respectively . at the volatile , passionate , but success-starved velodrome , the fans sing songs about argentina and chant bielsa 's name . in a blue-collar city where nobody says ` please ' , ` thank you ' or ` after you ' , the paying punter loves to hear stories of the players sweating , hard , for their salaries . yet the usual problems prevail . bielsa 's deal is for two years , but a ` break ' clause is available to either side in june . he wo n't even hint whether he 's going or staying . there are leaks that some players are exhausted . bielsa 's bible says , literally : ` running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything ' . at athletic bilbao , i know for a fact players still think he made them run through minor injuries , damaging their performances . javi martínez , if you got him to tell you the truth , left for bayern , in part , to get away from the guy . bielsa 's is the forrest gump method . bielsa pictured during the 2002 world cup in japan as argentina competed in group f bielsa took 7,000 videos of matches , goals , players , free-kicks , corners and penalties with him to japan after his first season with the basques ended in sequential 3-0 defeats in the europa league and copa del rey finals , he tried a ` but brutus is an honourable man ' speech on his players . in his 10-minute monologue he repeated his ` full responsibility ' but basically accused his squad of being cowardly , overpaid , shirkers who had bungled a chance of glory and betrayed the fans . someone in the dressing room recorded the fork-tongued diatribe and made the audio public . the ultimate betrayal , but caused by disengagement with the argentine . the plus-side -- as with the athletic team which wowed europe en route to dismantling manchester united in 2013 -- is that when his fanatical methods impact on his players and temporarily makes them super-fit , his teams can thrill . the down-side is the law of diminishing returns . something the local media understand far more quickly than anyone else . a couple of weeks ago , after a run of poor results , he lectured them . ` it 's completely clear that you 've got it all wrong , ' he accused . ` in the first part of the season , when we were winning , i was \" immense \" and the whole of french football should \" adopt my methods \" . now you say the opposite . bielsa 's bible states : ` running is commitment , running is understanding , running is everything ' ` it 's what has happened to me for the last 30 years . in negative moments everyone abandons you . ` in life we are attracted by what smells good and we flee from what smells bad . success improves your aroma and defeat gives you an odour . nobody , nobody , will accompany you to gaining success but everyone will flock to you to share your success once it 's gained . ' the latter part of which should n't , really , have appealed to his players . they won the next match 6-1 at toulouse . psg are a different matter . but to return to the original idea , this is where ` el loco ' yearns to be . nelson vivas recalls that when bielsa 's argentina were playing colombia away , he came in from the warm-up and told them : ` in a street fight , there are two kinds of guy . the one who strikes , sees blood , is repelled and recoils . then there 's one who sees blood and goes all-in to finish off the other . well lads ... i swear i smell blood in the air out there . ' so of what will bielsa smell on sunday night ?\n",

' ms le pen has blocked her father 's return to the party following accusations that he was trying to sabotage her party 's efforts to move into the political mainstream with a recent raft of controversial comments . tensions had escalated last week after the 86-year-old founder of the far-right party defended his previous comments describing nazi gas chambers as a ` detail of history ' . marine le pen ( left ) has accused her father ( right ) of trying to sabotage her party 's efforts to move into the political mainstream with a raft of controversial comments and yesterday , mr le pen was quoted as calling france 's spanish-born prime minister manuel valls ` the immigrant ' and defending philippe petain , leader of the war-time government that cooperated with nazi germany . ` jean-marie le pen seems to have descended into a strategy somewhere between scorched earth and political suicide , ' said marine le pen , who took over the party from her father in 2011 . ` his status as honorary president does not give him the right to hijack the national front with vulgar provocations seemingly designed to damage me but which unfortunately hit the whole movement , ' she said . ms le pen has tried to rid the anti-immigrant party of its anti-semitic image and widen its voter appeal as she readies a bid for the french presidency in 2017 . make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win . family at war : a bitter family feud has deepened between national front leader marine le pen ( right ) and her father jean-marie ( centre ) she added she would oppose her father 's bid to lead the party in the southern region of provence-alpes-cote d'azur in december local elections where the party is hoping to make gains after strong performances in town hall and departmental votes . ms le pen already distanced herself from her father last june after a quip about a french jewish singer that included an implied reference to concentration camp ovens . but last week mr le pen said he had ` never regretted ' his comments about the second world war gas chambers , which is likely to revive accusations that the far-right party remains anti-semitic . mr le pen , who is still an mep , said : ` the gas chambers were a detail of the war , unless we admit that the war was a detail of the gas chambers ! ' during an interview on bfm tv in paris , mr le pen said ` the truth ' should ` not shock anyone ' , and that historical reality should not be used to portray him as anti-jewish . ` this case was manipulated against me by introducing a hint of anti-semitism , ' said mr le pen . ' i challenge anyone to name an anti-semitic phrase in my political life . yesterday , jean-marie le pen was quoted as calling france 's spanish-born prime minister manuel valls ( right ) ` the immigrant ' and defending philippe petain , leader of the war-time government that cooperated with nazi germany ( left ) ` repeatedly questioned about the holocaust , mr le pen said : ` war is horrible , you know , a piece of shrapnel that tears your stomach , a bomb that decapitates you , a room in which you are asphyxiated , it 's all pretty disgusting , it 's true . ' following the comments , ms le pens said she ` deeply disagreed ' with her ` deliberately provocative ' father . speaking to the website of le figaro daily , she said : ' i deeply disagree with him . ' i take note of what he said but i believe that those coming over to vote for us understand what is going on . he is being deliberately provocative . ' ms le pen 's party regularly wins up to 25 per cent of the popular vote at local and regional elections , and ms le pen intends to stand for the job of president in 2017 . under her leadership , the party has deepened its roots across france , winning outright control of some town halls and getting its officials elected onto the councils of ` departements ' , broadly the equivalent of counties . polls suggest she could make it into the second-round run-off of a presidential election but is unlikely to win . marine accused her father of committing ` political suicide ' after he defended his past comment that nazi gas chambers were a ` detail of history ' last week while other fn officials have been stripped of their party membership for racism , there has been no move to bar jean-marie le pen from a party of which he still holds the title of honorary president . he is popular with many fn members and will stand as a candidate in december 's regional elections , despite having been convicted on numerous occasions of being anti-jewish and for ` inciting racial hatred ' . he has regularly made the comment about the holocaust , telling the european parliament in 2009 : ' i just said that the gas chambers were a detail of second world war history , which is clear . ' mr le pen was first convicted by a munich court in 1999 for ` minimising the holocaust ' after telling a german far-right meeting that nazi concentration camps and the gas chambers are ` what one calls a detail ' . he has had a string of other convictions , including ones for violence and was briefly banned from being an mep in 2003 following a physical attack on a french socialist mep . jews have complained of increasing anti-semitism in france , much of it stirred up by far-right activists . the nazi holocaust extended to france between 1940 and 1944 , when thousands of jews were entrained from cities like paris to the german gas chambers .\n",

' mr dryden told the court how the victim has had to attend a number of hospital appointments and have reconstructive surgery on her ear . when the victim visited the hospital the following day the police became involved and temple handed herself in to the police station . temple initially told police she was not the person who bit the victim . she agreed to have a dental impression taken by police but later refused claiming she was acting on legal advice . the 33-year-old ( pictured left ) carried out the attack before attempting to buy another drink from the bar . she and her sister louise scollen had got into a scuffle with shelley williams , who had part of her ear bitten off dawdon cricket club in seaham , county durham , where the incident happened . a marquee had been erected at the club for a charity hog roast event . police found the missing portion of miss williams ' ear the next day in a victim impact statement read to the court by mr dryden , miss williams said : ' i have become very self conscious and it has affected my confidence . ' i struggle to leave the house as i feel everyone is looking at me . i went out for a family meal and a male said to me are you the one who had your ear bitten off . i was embarrassed by this male 's comments . ' i booked a holiday and i was due to fly ten days after the assault took place . i was advised on medical grounds not to go because of risk of infection . i paid # 1,500 for the holiday and as i did n't want to let my children down i paid another # 400 for my parents to go with them .

' i was asked a long time ago to do some work on this and i was n't down for it . then they told me it was going to be a comedy , but it would not be racist , ' said anthony . ` so i agreed to it but on monday things started getting weird on the set . ' among the many problems he cited were the costumes that were being used , the way the hair was being styled , and the film 's treatment of women . ` we were supposed to be apache , but it was really stereotypical and we did not look apache at all . we looked more like comanche , ' he explained . ` one thing that really offended a lot of people was that there was a female character called beaver 's breath . one character says \" hey , beaver 's breath . \" and the native woman says , \" how did you know my name ? ' \" in another scene , an apache woman is seen squatting and urinating while smoking a pipe . as for the dress , the apache do not wear their hair in braids or chokers while that is common for comache . anthony ( on right with actor saginaw grant ) said the film was offensive towards native american women vanilla ice ( above as mark twain ) with sandler in the background in red bandanna were back to filming oin thursday anthony said that though the film is about the apache ( traditionl dress on left ) extras were dressed more like comanche ( traditional dress on right ) , with braids and chokers making matters worse says anthony is that no one felt like they were being listened to by the production team . ` they just treated us as if we should just be on the side , ' said anthony . ` when we did speak with the main director , he was trying to say the disrespect was not intentional and this was a comedy . ' the cultural adviser meanwhile asked to speak to sandler according to one extra , but was refused , and when that extra , goldie tom , later complained , she was told ; ` it 's in the script and we are not going to change it . ' tom later said on her facebook ; ` i 've had some time to sit and think about everything that 's been going on , on the set of this movie the ridiculous six . ` something just did n't feel right , i had a heavy heart while being on set but still tried to make the best of it . but after finding out what was in the script and what some of the movie scences portrayed , a group of us left the set upset and with our hearts pounding due to the disrespect of our native people . ` it 's been an emotional and upsetting time since we left the set but we have stood up for what we think is right and we are going to stand by our decision . still and always will represent our people !!! ' the film 's director frank coraci ( above ) with sandler on the set blake shelton ( above with whitney cummings ) has a small role in the film sandler and his production company happy madison have yet to comment , though netflix , who is producing the movie , did release a statement . ` the movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason : because it is ridiculous , ' they said . ` it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of - but in on - the joke . ' that cast includes taylor lautner , nick nolte , blake shelton , david spade and steve buscemi , among others . lautner has said before that he has distant native american ancestry on his mother 's side , specifically ottawa and potawatomi . producer heather parry ( second from right ) shared this photo from set earlier this month with david vspade , cummings and lautner steve buscemi also has a role in the film ( above with director coraci ) other stars in the film include lavell crawford ( top left ) , steve zahn ( top right ) , nick swardson ( middle right ) , will forte ( bottom left ) , and paul sado ( bottom right ) david hill , a 74-year-old choctaw , did not seem to feel like he was in on the joke as he too left the set . ` they were being disrespectful , ' he said . ` they were bringing up those same old arguments that dan snyder uses in defending the redskins . but let me tell you , our dignity is not for sale . it is a real shame because a lot of people probably stay because they need a job . ' he then added ; ` we understand this is a comedy , we understand this is humor , but we wo n't tolerate disrespect . i told the director if he had talked to a native woman the way they were talked to in this movie - i said i would knock his ass out . ' ` when i began doing this film , i had an uneasy feeling inside of me and i felt so conflicted , ' said allison young , a navajo who studied film at dartmouth . ' i talked to a former instructor at dartmouth and he told me to take this as finally experiencing stereotyping first hand . we talked to the producers about our concerns . ' filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees ( above ) the native american extras found so offensive young then explained that , just as anthony said , talking about her concerns with the production team did not work . ` they just told us , \" if you guys are so sensitive , you should leave , ' \" she said . ' i was just standing there and got emotional and teary-eyed . i did n't want to cry but the feeling just came over me . this is supposed to be a comedy that makes you laugh . a film like this should not make someone feel this way . ' despite this , filming seemed to continue on thursday , with vanilla ice , who plays mark twain in the film , posting a photo with sandler in the background . filming also went on wednesday after the extras walked off , with director frank coraci even posting a selfie of himself in front of the teepees the native american extras found so offensive . and not all the native americans on the set had issues with the script , with ricardo caté , a kewa pueblo native who also draws satirical cartoons , telling the sante fe new mexican ; ` there 's nothing worse [ in the script ] than anything in my cartoons . if anything racial or racist happened i would have walked off . the shoot has been fine , everybody has been happy .

            "miami ( cnn ) despite the glitz and glamour miami is known for , the odds for some children growing up there are bleak . almost one of every three miami-dade county residents living in poverty is under 18 , according to the department of regulatory and economic resources . many schools face high dropout rates , after-school programs are being eliminated and students are failing . those at-risk children are ones that chad bernstein is trying to help through his nonprofit , guitars over guns . \" music is the most important tool we have in reaching these kids , \" said bernstein , 30 , a professional musician . his program operates in two of miami 's poorest communities , north miami and allapattah . it pairs middle-school students with professional musicians , providing free instrument instruction and mentorship . since 2008 , bernstein 's organization has worked with more than 225 students in miami-dade county . he says his group has seen more than a 90 % increase in academic performance and school attendance of students in the program . do you know a hero ? nominations are open for cnn heroes 2015 bernstein has been hooked on playing gigs since he was 16 . he 's gone on to play and record with such musical greats as shakira , pharrell , jennifer hudson and pitbull . i sat down with bernstein to learn more about the motivation behind his work . below is an edited version of our conversation . marissa calhoun : you 're a pretty cool guy -- some might be surprised to hear that you were once bullied . what did you experience and how did you overcome it ? chad bernstein : when i was a kid , i had ears that stuck out the side of my head and really big green glasses . and i was tall and lanky and definitely looked a little different than other kids . i think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something , because i just did n't feel like i fit in with the other kids . when i started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity , something that i belonged to , something that i was good at , something that people would watch me do and say , \" oh wow , that 's really cool or he 's really good at that . \" i think in that way music really gave me an anchor in my social experience . calhoun : what can students expect when they join your program ? bernstein : as a new gogo student you 'll get to try out all the instruments . you 'll choose an instrument to learn . you 'll be paired with a mentor . and then you 'll go throughout that year learning how to play the instrument and music fundamentals and songwriting . and by the end of the year , you 'll be performing on stage , recording in a studio and will have a very close relationship with that mentor . our mentors are amazing musicians that are active in the community playing and performing . and some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently . we 're in a unique position to really talk to these kids about the issues that matter most to them . calhoun : why do you focus on middle schoolers ? bernstein : it 's the time of their life to reach them not only musically , but also as young individuals that are starting to form opinions about who they are and what their world is going to look like . as professional musicians , most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life . and the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school . a lot of times , these kids only see to the end of their block and back . we like to bring them to studios and also to other places in miami because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood . we also provide them with opportunities to get tutoring and have social services , making sure that they 're really successful in and outside of school . calhoun : i 've heard you play -- you 're pretty mean on the trombone . how has that passion translated into your work with these kids ? bernstein : i 've built my life on how important the feeling i get from playing music is . and i thought that that was the end-all , be-all feeling , that being on stage and performing was the thing for me . then i saw a kid have that experience through our program , and it changed everything . there 's an amazing sense of pride when i see a kid experience that feeling on stage , where they 've connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because they 've worked really hard and have a great performance . it 's an incredible feeling . i was really fortunate to have the opportunities that i did to learn music . and part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people , because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me . my hopes for the children that we work with are that their vision of the world and their vision of themselves is changed in some way , that they hold themselves to more than other people might , and that they realize there 's a whole world out there that they could very much be a part of that is n't necessarily the one right outside their doorstep . i know music has changed my life in a really dramatic way . and i think it 's going to change the lives of these students in a really dramatic way . check out the guitars over guns website at www.guitarsoverguns.org and see how to help . nominations are open for 2015 cnn heroes\n",

            "the codpieces used in the hit bbc drama wolf hall were too small and should have been double the size , according to an expert . this is one of a number of inaccuracy spotted in the big budget adaptation of hilary mantel 's books and was said to have been done so as not to offend and baffle the shows american audience . victoria miller , who has researched the codpiece for her phd , said those used in the show would have been far too modest for henry viii 's court . damien lewis , pictured left , with a small and modest codpiece , and a renaissance portrait , right , with a much more noticeable and prominent garment homeland star damian lewis played henry viii in the six-part series on the rapid rise to power of sir thomas cromwell in king henry 's court ` they 're way too small to be accurate -- they should be at least double the size , ' said the cambridge academic , according to the guardian . ` you can kind of see them there , but they are n't really stuffed , and are easily missed -- they 've really toned them down for a mainstream audience . ` the codpiece was meant to draw the eye to the general region . ' mark rylance , who played thomas cromwell , blamed there diminutive size on a ` directive from our american producers ' . ' i was n't personally disappointed by the codpieces : i 'm a little more used to them than other people from being at the globe for ten years , ' rylance said , according to the daily telegraph . ` but i can see for modern audiences , perhaps more in america , they may not know exactly what 's going on down there . ' in the time of henry viii the codpiece was a fashion accessory , which was said to be a symbol of a tudor man 's ` virility ' . damian lewis , who played henry viii , admitted that the codpieces were a source of some ` giggling ' during filming . this is not the first time that the show has come under fire for historical errors . when it first aired , historians criticised the decision to cast kate phillips as henry viii 's third wife jayne seymour because she was too pretty . seymour seen in a portrait by tudor artist hans holbein , is depicted with a noticeably large forehead , double chin , and thin pursed lips . according to lucy worsley , 41 , chief curator at historic royal palaces , miss phillips , 25 , has features which are too dainty . miss worsley said : ` she 's too pretty . i did challenge peter kosminsky [ the director ] about that . he laughed and said , \" i picked her because of her acting , not because of her forehead \" . ' historians also pointed out that montacute house in somerset , which was used to portray greenwich palace , is from the elizabethan period . historian lucy worsley has said that kate phillips , pictured left , who plays henry viii 's wife jane seymour , portrait pictured right , in bbc drama wolf hall is too pretty miss worsley has previously questioned the authenticity of some aspects of the programme , claiming both the original books and now this adaptation have brought the characters firmly into the modern day . she said : ` what hilary mantel has done is made these characters people for our times , which is interesting for a historian to watch . they are immensely modern , they wo n't be saying thee and thou and being all dramatic and over the top . ' i think it will make people think the tudors were just like us in many ways . that 's a massive historical question , in some ways they were and in some ways they were n't . ' the programme-makers have revealed the lengths they have gone to to ensure historical accuracy -- including an unexpected insistence on straight , white teeth and pristine linen . mantel said a tudor drama would be less accurate had it insisted on blackened teeth and filthy courtiers -- as it was a time when sugar was yet to become widely available .\n",

            "arrested : doug hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace the postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the u.s. capitol is facing two criminal charges . but he 's being released from federal custody to return to florida . doug hughes made his initial appearance in u.s. district court in washington on thursday . that 's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the capitol 's west lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the national mall . he was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . hughes said it was a political protest . hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in tampa starting next week . in a soft voice , hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant . homeland security secretary jeh johnson said thursday that the copter ` apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . johnson said it 's too soon to say whether wednesday 's incident should prompt changes in security procedures . ' i want to know all the facts before i reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future , ' he said . but lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security , especially amid revelations that the pilot , florida postal worker doug hughes , was interviewed by the secret service almost two years ago . the agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat , said rep. elijah cummings , d-md. , the senior democrat on the house oversight and government reform committee . cummings spoke thursday with the secret service director . ' i think that there 's absolutely a gap , and it 's a very dangerous gap , with regard to our airspace , ' cummings said . ' i do n't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere . suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle ? that could have been a major catastrophe . ' homeland security secretary jeh johnson said thursday that the copter ` apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why approach : the small gyro-copter ( circled in red ) lands on the west lawn of the capitol in washington as members of the public walk by . the stunt has n't cost him his freedom , yet , but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial johnson said the secret service passed along the information from the interview with hughes , who was to appear in court thursday afternoon , to ` all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies . ' house minority leader nancy pelosi , d-calif. , called the incident ` stunning . ' ` what safeguards can we use ? we do n't want to be a place where we 're saying ` this is an iron-clad capitol . ' and have such restrictions on people having access to it , ' pelosi told reporters . ` nonetheless , we have to ensure the safety of those people . ' the tiny , open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone , but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from gettysburg , pennsylvania , right up to the capitol . hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics , and deliver letters to all 535 members of congress on the topic . ` we are a democracy . we do n't have fences around our airspace , so we 've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings , ' johnson told reporters on capitol hill . ` and so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this , but then again , you do n't want to overreact , either . ' still , lawmakers questioned why , if authorities had been in touch with hughes , no action was taken to stop him . practice run : doug hughes flies his gyrocopter near the wauchula municipal airport in wauchula , florida prior to his ` insane ' stunt on wednesday before doug hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the u.s. capitol grounds , he blogged about his intention to undertake the ` non-violent demonstration . ' though , it may have been a demonstration years in the making . in a post dated september 2013 on the democracyclub.org , a writer called tampadoug47 wrote : let me say first -- this is a non-violent demonstration . i have no intention of hurting anyone -- i have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone , including me . there is no way i can prevent over-reaction by the authorities , but i have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows . when i took off , i was over an hour away from the no-fly zone . the demonstration is about restoring democracy . corruption in washington dc has robbed the us citizens of the representative government that is our birthright . polls show that the public is aware of the problem and very concerned , but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality . as a result of this flight , two things will happen . first , we 're going to change the narrative -- the story . voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue . congress wo n't start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business . lobbyists , special interests , unions . we have to make this happen . the political parties wo n't . lobbyists love the status quo . the mainstream media ( not the local media ) is making a financial killing with mega-elections . it 's up to us . second , in every congressional race in 2016 , i want every candidate to take a stand on corruption . after this flight , we 're going to define exactly what reform means -- set a written standard -- and it 's that standard which candidates will have to endorse . or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position . the candidate who only wants to talk ` reform ' but wo n't endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform . that may be in the primary or the general election . giving you a choice is our job . the clear choice , establishment or reform , will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races . you get to choose ( that 's your job as a voter . ) but for the first time in decades , you will have a meaningful choice . what do i want from you ? look over your options on the previous screen or the ` honor roll ' on the sidebar to the right . rootstrikers or wolf pac or represent.us . my favorite group is n't listed there -- it 's my own startup group : ` the civilist papers ` . find a group ( or groups ) that you are comfortable with and sign up . we 're not after money -- we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed . protest flight : doug hughes took off from an undisclosed location in washington d.c. and landed his gyro-copter on the west front lawn of the us capitol building ` my concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response , ' said rep. michael mccaul , r-texas , chairman of the house homeland security committee . ` these small aircraft or uav devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage , so that 's something we 're taking a look at , ' mccaul said , adding he might hold hearings on the issue . cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media . johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over washington , d.c. , federal buildings and monuments . ` we 've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission , ' he said . he said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask , ` what 's a gyrocopter ? ' it 's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar . unlike most larger aircraft , a gyrocopter does n't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft , its altitude and heading . even without a transponder , radar can detect ` primary targets ' - planes , flocks of birds , rain and other objects . but how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors . the landing on the capitol grounds ` just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier . it 's very hard to hermetically seal airspace , ' said john hansman , a massachusetts institute of technology aeronautics professor . evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by florida mailman doug hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by florida mailman doug hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform\n",

            "shelly sterling has spoken out about her legal victory over her husband 's alleged mistress v. stiviano , saying she took the much-younger woman to court ` for justice ' . the billionaire wife of former los angeles clippers owner donald sterling said she felt vindicated by the judge 's ruling this week that stiviano , 32 , must return $ 2.6 million in sugar daddy gifts . donald sterling , 80 , had lavished his alleged girlfriend with gifts including a $ 1.8 million house , luxury cars and stocks - all while hiding them from his wife of six decades . but shelly insisted on wednesday she did n't take them to court over the money . vindicated : shelly sterling , pictured at a clippers game last month , will receive $ 2.6 million from a woman her husband donald showered with gifts . shelly has said she took the woman to court ` for justice ' ' i did it for justice , ' she said . ' i think when somebody harms you in so many ways , justice has to prevail . ' shelly sterling said she would donate the proceeds to charity . despite acknowledging marital problems , she also said she and her husband never separated . she said she drafted divorce papers last year , but never filed them . the couple testified at trial last month in los angeles superior court about their love for each other , displaying cards they had exchanged . still , donald sterling is suing his wife and the nba over the $ 2 billion sale of the team . a year ago , a recording of donald sterling telling stiviano not to associate with black people led the nba to ban him for life and fine him $ 2.5 million . his wife then negotiated a deal to sell the team with ex-microsoft ceo steve ballmer after doctors found donald sterling incompetent to handle his business affairs . together : donald sterling is pictured with v. stiviano in 2011 as they watch the clippers play . he lost the team last year after a recording emerged in which he told stiviano not to be seen with black people shelly added on wednesday that she mourns the loss of the team . ` it was a horrible thing to go through , ' she said . ` they were like my family . to this day i still feel very bad about it . ' her husband 's lawyer on wednesday criticized her lawsuit as a ` pet project ' that had extended stiviano 's time in the spotlight . ` the sums spent by shelly sterling in pursuing this matter likely exceeds any amount that will be recovered , ' attorney bobby samini said . ` we remain perplexed that so much time , energy and money have been allocated to litigating with ms. stiviano . ' shelly sterling 's attorney scoffed at that statement . ` what do you expect from the lawyer for a husband who was caught red-handed gifting his mistress with millions of dollars of family money , ' pierce o'donnell said . in court : stiviano , pictured heading to court last month , accepted gifts worth $ 2.6 million from the older man and has now been ordered to hand them back over . the exact nature of their relationship was never clear shelly sterling had filed the suit against stiviano a month before the recording of her husband telling stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the nba to ban him for life . in court , shelly sterling 's lawyers used other recordings from stivian 's iphone to show he bought his alleged mistress a house , a ferrari and other things . stiviano and the 80-year-old billionaire were heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife . ` the truth is that everything that i have , you 've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you , ' stiviano said in snippet played in court . during the course of their two and a half years together , sterling gave her a ferrari , a bentley and a range rover , and paid the lion 's share of a $ 1.8 million duplex . sterling testified that he paid for the house , though stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer . but judge richard fruin jr. said this claim was ` not believable ' and he relied instead on a recording in which she told donald sterling : ' i want shelly to know you bought me the house . ' still smiling : stiviano , pictured showing off her new braces , was seen out in los angeles earlier this month he ruled earlier this week that stiviano must now turn over the keys to the $ 1.8 million house and pay shelly sterling some $ 800,000 that her husband showered on the younger woman in gifts . it was stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to clippers games . in the subsequent furor , the nba banned sterling from the league for life , and he was ultimately forced to sell the clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $ 2 billion . the recording was leaked weeks after shelly sterling sued stiviano , alleging she was her husband 's mistress but the exact nature of their relationship was never clear . stiviano called him a lover and father figure but said they never had sex . donald sterling called her an ` ex-friend ' on the witness stand , though he said in recordings that he loved her and wanted to give her everything .\n",

            "a saturday night live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy 's dream , but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media . the reaction to the comedy sketch reflected a growing view among law enforcement and victims ' advocacy groups that it is no laughing matter when a woman educator preys on her male students . in u.s. schools last year , almost 800 school employees were prosecuted for sexual assault , nearly a third of them women . new jersey high school english teacher nicole dufault , left , stands accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys , while kathryn ronk , right , a spanish teacher at bishop foley high school in michigan got up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy the proportion of women facing charges seems to be higher than in years past , when female teachers often got a pass , said terry abbott , a former chief of staff at the u.s. department of education , who tracked the cases . this year 's numbers are already slightly ahead of last year with 26 cases of female school employees accused of inappropriate relationships with male students in january compared to 19 cases the previous january . female educators who sexually abuse their students are facing tougher prosecution in part because there are more women police officers . there is also a greater awareness among prosecutors , judges and the general public that students who are victimized by an authority figure , regardless of gender , experience trauma with life-long consequences . ` law enforcement is increasingly feminized , and women are much less prone to the old attitude : \" oh , this is just some kid who got lucky , ' \" said david finkelhor , director of the crimes against children research center . ` they recognize the issues involved and they go after women who violate the statutes . ' a recent saturday night live skit about a male student having sex with his female high school teacher painted the relationship as every teen boy 's dream , but drew a firestorm of criticism on social media the twitter furor ignited by the april snl skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his ` hot ' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing depression , low-self esteem and difficulty maintaining future relationships are among the long-term consequences that male victims face , according to experts . those problems are sometimes compounded by confusion and guilt over whether they are actually victims since their adolescent bodies involuntarily respond to physical contact . child abuse experts agree it appears female teachers are being prosecuted more vigorously than in the past . the crackdown is the result of ` two seismic shifts , ' said christopher anderson , executive director of male survivor , the largest u.s. advocacy organization for male sex-crime victims . pennsylvanian math teacher erica ann ginnetti , 35 , was sentenced to 30 days in jail for having sex with a 17-year-old student . the male judge said , ` what young man would not jump on that candy ? ' ` one is a recognition that it does not matter who the perpetrator is or what the circumstances are . a teacher has absolutely no business engaging in sexual contact with a student , ' anderson said . ` the second is a shift in the culture where boys and their parents are feeling empowered to come forward to say that something has been done . ' in recent weeks , a stamford , connecticut high school english teacher , danielle watkins , 32 , whose case was prosecuted by a female state 's attorney , was sentenced to up to 10 years in prison for having sex with an underage male student . in michigan , a female judge sentenced kathryn ronk , 30 , a spanish teacher at bishop foley high school in madison heights , to up to 15 years in prison for having a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old boy , saying ` the law does not recognize a double standard . ' in new jersey , a female prosecutor said the most lenient plea deal she would offer nicole dufault , 35 , a columbia high school english teacher accused of sexual relationships with six teenage boys , was 15 years in prison . there are contrary examples , such as pennsylvania 's erica ann ginnetti , 35 , the lower moreland high school math teacher who had sex with a 17-year-old student and was sentenced to 30 days in jail by a male judge who said , ` what young man would not jump on that candy ? ' that was after a female prosecutor reportedly said in court that the victim 's senior year became a nightmare , his grades plunged and he still struggles with social interactions . but the twitter furor ignited by the april snl skit in which a male judge fist-bumps a boy who had sex with his ` hot ' teacher indicates how attitudes are changing . ` appalled by the #snl sketch glorifying sexual abuse of a male student by female teacher . sends the worst message & minimizes real experiences , ' tweeted heather timmis @hnt108 . an snl spokesperson declined to comment . there is no central u.s. reporting system for tracking female teachers who prey on male students , according to federal education officials , but abbott has been charting the crimes from news coverage . his research showed that female teachers far more often than male teachers use social media to lure students , creating an electronic ` paper trail ' that may aid prosecutions . school districts are increasingly moving to ban private social media contact between teachers and students , sometimes in an effort to prevent inappropriate relationships . ` social media enables the behavior to start , ' abbott said . ` there is no way that a teacher is going to walk up to a kid in the hallway and say , \" hey , would you like to see a naked picture of me ? \" they wo n't do it . but they will do that on social media . it 's like it erases what used to be that barrier .

            "washington ( cnn ) until recently , if you sat in church on sunday mornings , pollsters could predict where you stood on same-sex marriage . what a difference a decade makes . in 2003 , when the massachusetts supreme court became the country 's first to legalize same-sex marriage , less than 30 % of religiously affiliated americans supported gays ' and lesbians ' right to wed. . by 2014 , that number had climbed to 47 % , according to a survey conducted by the public religion research institute . that 's more than the 45 % who said they opposed same-sex nuptials . the margin is small but statistically significant , said robert p. jones , ceo of prri , because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents : 40,000 adult americans . ( eight percent refused to answer or said they did n't know their stance on same-sex marriage . ) according to prri 's poll , there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it , a dramatic turn in one of this country 's most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race . \" there 's been a huge swing in the last decade , \" said jones . \" there are now big , mainstream groups on both sides of the debate . \" if the u.s. supreme court has been paying attention , it likely saw this trend coming . each time the high court has considered a case related to same-sex marriage , the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller , and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse . on tuesday , for example , as the supreme court hears oral arguments in obergefell v. hodges , a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same-sex marriage , an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of washington 's national cathedral is planning to march in support of lgbt rights . \" i join with many across the spectrum of american faith communities in my hope that the court 's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states , \" the very rev. gary hall , the cathedral 's dean , said in a statement . \" i trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek god 's blessing on their marriages . \" clergy from hall 's religious denomination , the episcopal church , have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same-sex marriage . the brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders , including rabbis , methodist ministers , lutheran bishops , seminary professors and congregationalist chaplains . another brief , submitted by the anti-defamation league , is signed by jewish , hindu and presbyterian groups . in a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage , some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials . prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well , including the u.s. conference of catholic bishops , national association of evangelicals , southern baptist convention , assemblies of god and the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints , also known as the mormon church . together , leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million americans . but as prri 's survey shows , there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews . despite vocal opposition from the u.s. catholic bishops , for example , 60 % of catholics now favor same-sex marriage . that 's a huge increase from 2003 , when just 35 % backed gay rights , according to survey conducted at the time by the pew research center . mainline protestants -- so-called for their prominence in 20th century american life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade . while 36 % supported same-sex marriage in 2003 , now 62 % do . at a glance , the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse , encompassing buddhists , catholics , jews and hindus . but the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley , bridging black protestants , mormons , muslims and white evangelicals , according to prri 's survey . legalized nationwide : argentina , belgium , canada , denmark , iceland , netherlands , norway , portugal , spain , south africa , sweden legalized in certain regions : brazil , mexico , united states civil unions or domestic partnerships : andorra , austria , brazil , colombia , czech republic , ecuador , finland , france , germany , greenland , hungary , ireland , liechtenstein , luxembourg , new zealand , slovenia , switzerland , united kingdom , uruguay and parts of australia , mexico , united states and venezuela the survey data comes from prri 's american values atlas , conducted between april and december of last year . prri is a nonpartisan , nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and american culture . separate surveys conducted by prri and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger americans . seven in 10 millennials , for example , support same-sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics . half of millennial republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry , and 43 % of white evangelical millennials agree . those numbers could put gop presidential candidates in a tight spot , said jones , as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger americans . \" the real challenge for gop candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation , \" jones said . politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage , but bible-believing christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them , said denny burk , a professor at boyce college , a southern baptist school in louisville , kentucky . \" for me , the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue . there are periods when the gospel is popular and periods when it 's not . you ca n't base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment . \" still , burk said he does n't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage , and he fully expects the supreme court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this june when the justices render a decision in obergefell v. hodges . but the fight is far from over , burk said . \" just like we 've seen this decades-long culture war with abortion , we 're going to see the same thing with gay marriage . \"\n",

            "( cnn ) a jury of rolling stone 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia , and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism . rolling stone 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable . the magazine 's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not . before the original story , \" a rape on campus , \" was pulled from the rolling stone website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history . an anonymous undergraduate , given the name \" jackie , \" told rolling stone writer sabrina rubin erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by phi kappa psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys , who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student , a casual acquaintance , who had invited jackie to the party . the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity , a police investigation , the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses . but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t. rees shapiro took a closer look , leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism . that review , which is considerably longer than the original article , reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice . rolling stone writer erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of jackie 's friends who allegedly talked with jackie immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when . and at every step of the way , when jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither erdely nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story . having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade ( including one semester at columbia ) , i would agree with colleagues who call rolling stone 's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom . i 've told students for years : you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond . and you should never take a source 's word about important facts without verifying the truth . ( there 's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation . ) most of all , i tell students , remember that you 're writing about human beings , who are complicated creatures : the good guys are never all that good , and the bad guys usually are n't completely bad . people can be mistaken or deceitful , i tell young reporters , they frequently forget and often lie to themselves . that does n't make a source useless , but it must make you extra careful . unfortunately , the early word from rolling stone is that they 've absorbed none of these lessons . publisher jann wenner has apparently decided not to fire , demote or discipline anybody at rolling stone , provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists . \" no one fired at rolling stone . wrote cnn media critic brian stelter . \" what would rolling stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably , damaged people 's lives , but punished no one ? \" tweeted john bresnahan , the capitol bureau chief of politico . \" rolling stone outsources its investigation to columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward ? ok ... , \" tweeted pundit joe concha . worse still , the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle , framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim . \" rolling stone 's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story 's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems , \" the columbia report says . and check out this amazing conclusion from will dana , the managing editor who presided over the disaster . dana told the columbia team : \" it 's not like i think we need to overhaul our process , and i do n't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things . we just have to do what we 've always done and just make sure we do n't make this mistake again . \" that smug attitude pretty much ensures rolling stone 's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future . at a minimum , they should heed the wise counsel of my friend bill grueskin , an executive editor at bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the columbia j-school . \" when doing big , investigative stories , reporters face many challenges : recalcitrant sources , complex numbers , buried records . editors , whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity , are spared most of those hurdles . but they face their own internal newsroom challenges , particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story , \" grueskin writes . \" they must keep their star reporters happy , trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative , and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic . \" the problem could be , says grueskin , that rolling stone had too many chefs in the kitchen , instead of \" a single , talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae . \" until wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring , editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the rolling stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another , one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming .\n",

' i put them under the cold tap and looked at him . his skin was red hot and burning . it was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size . ' the family visited their gp , who suggested that james might be allergic to grass . ` he was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away , ' his mother said . ` but it kept happening and i took james to the doctors three times that week . ` painkillers and allergy tablets did n't help . every time he was outside , any exposed skin became red raw , his face and hands would swell up . he would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference . ' eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition . ` we were told to wrap him up and use the special cream , ' mrs creag added . ` so , even if it 's overcast , james still wears a hat , scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin . the dundee cream is so important .

' i think that is normal in the world we live in , ' mignolet said . ` social media is something worldwide and you ca n't control it yourself really but you have to accept it . ` the spotlight is on you so you have to deal with those sort of things . ' but stoke manager mark hughes said he would welcome tougher sanctions against individuals who indulge in online abuse , believing they are safe behind the cloak of anonymity . ` the internet is difficult to police as we well know , but anything racist , homophobic - even just in general life - it should be rooted out and stamped on , ' hughes said . ` it is not acceptable . the fact people can hide behind their computers on the internet makes it more difficult to manage and stop . stoke city boss mark hughes has called for a crackdown on racism and an end to online anonymity ` but there needs to be a will and if there is a way of stopping this happening , then that should be encouraged .

            "conrad clitheroe , left , and gary cooper , right , were thrown in jail after being arrested for writing down aircraft registration numbers in dubai three british planespotters who have spent two months in prison in the united arab emirates after they were arrested on national security grounds have been released . conrad clitheroe , 54 and gary cooper , 45 , from stockport , along with their ex-pat friend neil munro were stopped by police for writing down aircraft registration numbers at fujairah airport . they were taken to a police station and , despite being told they would not be detained , were put into prison . clitheroe 's wife valerie had written to british prime minister david cameron to ask him to intervene in the case , raising concerns about her husband 's health due to his heart murmur and high blood pressure . they were finally told earlier this week that they could return home after charges of espionage would not be brought against them . a spokesman for the british foreign office said : ` we can confirm the release of three british nationals detained in fujairah , united arab emirates on february 21 . ` we are providing consular assistance . ' attorney nasser hashem previously said the men would be free to go after the court accepted a defense argument that they were pursuing their passion for plane spotting and had no ill intent . mr clitheroe will now be able to return home to celebrate his first wedding anniversary with his wife on may 9 . speaking earlier this week , mrs clitheroe said : ' i am absolutely ecstatic . apart from our wedding and the birth of my children this is the best day of my life . ' i just ca n't wait to see him , to hug him , to hold him . ` we got a call from the lawyer to tell us he 'd been in court and the case had been dropped . ` we then confirmed it with the consulate . ' i am just so happy , we 've been ringing everyone to let them now . i 'm in a bit of shock too , i do n't feel like it can be real . ` how can you hold someone for that long with no charges ? i do n't understand it but i 'm so so glad . ' earlier this month , mrs clitheroe had raised concerns because her husband had run out of blood pressure medication . valerie clitheroe ( pictured with her husband ) said both he and mr cooper had been keen plane spotters since boyhood and pleaded for their release the men had travelled to dubai for a four-day holiday on february 18 . all three friends were keen to see fujairah airport , which is used by older and rarer aircraft . they drove the 70-mile journey there on february 21 , but were stopped by an off-duty policeman after they slowed down to note the registration numbers of planes . mr clitheroe has always insisted they never took any photographs . although plane spotting is not illegal in the united arab emirates , it is not understood and is frowned upon . the men were taken to a police station , where they were allegedly told they could only leave if they signed a form in arabic saying they would not practise their hobby there again . but after signing the document , without asking for a translation , they were kept in custody overnight . they were brought before a prosecutor the next day and then moved to fujairah prison . mr clitheroe posted this picture on february 19 as he pursued his hobby at the sheraton deira hotel in dubai their case was escalated to a matter of ` national security ' . sharing a cell with over 20 others , eating on the floor and forced to stare at the four walls for most of the day , the families were concerned about their welfare - particularly as mr clitheroe needs medication for his heart condition . a judge last month extended their custody licence , which was up again on april 12 , but an admin error delayed the hearing until this week . mrs clitheroe added : ` conrad was beginning to think the worse and that they would never be released . ` things had seemed to be so against them from the start that they thought it was going to end badly . the men were held after being seen by police writing down aircraft registration numbers at fujairah airport ` we thought they would be charged with something and fined so it 's come as a shock that there are no charges at all . we had started planning to go out there to deal with the lawyers face to face . ' mrs clitheroe said the men had been keen plane spotters since they were children . the families of mr clitheroe and mr cooper were helped by charity ` detained in dubai ' to pay # 9,000 for a lawyer to fight their case . a crowd-funding site set up by the men 's work colleagues has raised more than # 5,000 . earlier this week , radha stirling , the founder of detained in dubai said charges of espionage against the trio had finally been dropped at the supreme court in abu dhabi . ` the charges are being dropped with no fines or penalties . they 've had a long time to wait to be told your case is ridiculous , ' said ms stirling .\n",

' he continued : ` our study , which was controlled for prior attainment and also how good students were at dealing with exam pressure , found that increased worry still predicted lower achievement . ' with that in mind , how can you best ensure your offspring rides the exam storm and comes out the other end feeling happy and achieving what they 'd hoped for ? femail has enlisted the help of michael ribton , principal at burlington danes academy in west london , which achieved an outstanding grade at its last ofsted inspection , to offer some sage advice to parents and students on how to get through the tricky months ahead . if ribton is more than used to getting teenagers to apply themselves in his day job , he 's also used to it at home . this summer , his son joe , 18 , will sit a levels , while his daughter maddy , 16 , will take her gcses . he says : ` our may half-term holiday has been cancelled so that they are free to get on with revision . ` their bedrooms are adorned with flashcards and files ; their revision timetables and exam timetables are on display in the kitchen . it 's a busy time ! ' principal at burlington danes academy michael ribton , pictured above ( left ) helping a pupil to revise , says parents should pin their offspring 's revision timetable on the fridge and really engage with them during the lead up to the stressful exam period here , he offers his essential guide to how to ease the passage of students bound for the exam hall : devise a bespoke revision plan that includes rewards of time off ` draw up a revision timetable and stick to it . ` set yourself goals and reward yourself with time off . a common error is forgetting to add up your cumulative hours on each subject so that you are not overly focusing on one subject . ` parents need to be part of this as well . a revision timetable should be on the fridge at home ! ` students also need to find the way that suits them best , though there are some foundation blocks to any revision programme that are essential . ` and know what to revise : exam websites are really useful , but do make sure you know the precise course and paper reference codes . ' parents should engage with their children at exam time : test them on anything they need to learn by rote and make sure they get a healthy breakfast and plenty of weekend exercise find a quiet place , switch off the internet and do practice questions ` students need a place to revise , free from distractions and that includes the internet . though it contains lots of great support material , it can be quite a distraction . ` revision is not simply re-reading exercise books ! it ought to be complemented by undertaking practice questions ; challenging oneself is an essential core component of revision too . ' burlington danes academy student fatima sharif , achieved 4as and 1b grade at as level last summer . the student , from white city in west london , currently has conditional offers from five of the country 's top universities including oxford to study english literature . although fatima does n't have a definite career plan , she is interested in teaching . here , she explains how she 's currently dealing with revising for her a level exams : fatima sharif is due to sit five a levels this summer and has a conditional offer from oxford ` in order to motivate myself to revise , i think about what i really want to achieve ; being really successful , or getting into a great university , and those thoughts really keeps me going . ' i set myself a goal , and my continual motivation is achieving that goal , because i know that it will all be worth it if i just put effort into it now . ` personally , i do n't really benefit from timetables as i fear that if i am not strictly adhering to them , i am somehow not effectively revising . ` but i definitely recognise that timetables can be incredibly helpful for students as they give them a set time to work and rest , and they break down the huge amounts of work they have into effective revision time . i would definitely recommend a revision timetable to students . ' ` although my family has n't offered me treats if i do well , i have promised myself them ! during my as exams i really wanted a kindle , so i told myself that as soon as i got through the tough exams i 'd treat myself to one . ' i think revision has more significance if you promise yourself something . it does n't have to be big , just something small to direct you on the right course . fatima 's top three tips for successful revision use revision aids including flashcards , post-it notes and highlighters ` ensure your child has the tools they need to revise and keep in close contact with the school to find out what they advise you can do to help your child . ` at ark burlington danes , we hand out revision booklets ( that contain the basic knowledge for all subjects ) , flashcards , highlighters and post-it notes . ` we also send text messages , hold intervention classes , cram timetables and do mock exams and questions . ' do n't be afraid to try new techniques ` \" spaced learning \" has worked well for us : it 's a ` cramming ' technique based on neuro-scientific research , which enables the memory process to take place very quickly -- quickly enough to cover and retain a whole subject module 's content in approximately an hour . ' a spaced learning session consists of three identical ` inputs ' on powerpoint slides divided by 10-minute breaks filled with ` brain gym ' activities . ` watching a whole year group learn , say , about theories on the existence of god and then stand up to write their names in the air backwards with their non writing hand is hilarious ! ' a positive attitude is essential for both parents and students draw up a revision timetable and stick to it revise in a quiet place , free from distractions ( switch off the internet if you need to ) use practice questions to hone technique buy flashcards , post-it notes and highlighters ! try cram techniques such as ` spaced learning ' which can train the brain into retaining information put your child 's revision timetable on the fridge at home do n't bribe your child : the best prize they can have is education ask your offspring to explain their work to you ; it 'll help them to understand it more fully offer to test them on the things that they need to learn by rote ensure they breakfast well and exercise together on the weekends how can parents help with revision ? ` parents play a crucial part . ` firstly , take a close interest in your child 's learning , preferably always but especially at exam time . ` ask your child to explain difficult concepts as teaching someone else is the best way to learn yourself . test them on anything they need to learn by rote . ` be positive : high expectations matter and you can not get away from the fact that exams are a stressful time . ` all a parent can do is to help their child have the very best chance of success and provide every opportunity for their child to give it their best shot . ' make sure they eat well and exercise ` feed your child properly throughout the exam season ; a good breakfast helps and ensure they get a proper night 's sleep too . ` at arkbda we provide a healthy breakfast for all pupils and we 've found that it really boosts levels of engagement . ` know when their exams are , set your alarm clock and get up with them to help them get organised . ` at weekends , get some exercise together . ' should you pay for extra tuition ? it ought not be necessary in good or better schools , but a tutor can help boost the confidence of a child . i would hope the parents at my school would talk with me first before investing money to support their child . an outstanding school would see this as a failure on their part . bribes are n't the answer ! a good education is a reward in itself , it opens so many doors .\n",

( the \" whisky \" spelling generally refers to scotches or canadian varieties , while \" whiskey \" refers to irish or american styles . ) its slogan is \" tastes like heaven , burns like hell , \" but that 's an exaggeration . fireball has a kick , but it does n't burn as much as straight whiskeys , cheap tequilas or even the atomic fireball hard candy that helped inspire its name . it 's also only 66 proof , or 33 % alcohol -- less than most whiskeys . \" it 's so easy to drink that you forget you 're drinking alcohol . you hardly taste the whiskey at all , \" said zachary jones , a bartender at community smith in atlanta . \" i 've known people who ca n't do shots , but they can do fireball . \" fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women , many of whom say they like that it does n't singe their throat and leaves a dentyne-like aftertaste . but not everyone is a fan . whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single-malt scotches -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff . \" i 've got to be honest : it 's not anything i 'd reach for , at any occasion , \" bryson said . \" but clearly i 'm not in the mainstream . \" fireball was n't always fireball . it used to be known as dr. mcgillicuddy 's fireball whisky before its maker , the sazerac co. , rebranded it in 2006 . sales were modest until about five years ago , when sazerac hired a \" national brand ambassador , \" richard pomes , to spread the word about fireball through event planning and bartender outreach . in other words , pomes traveled the country serving up fireball shots in bars . he started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures , such as austin and nashville , and then spread to other places . everywhere he went , pomes shared his fireballing exploits on facebook , twitter and instagram and encouraged patrons to do the same . soon , fireball started gaining traction . retail sales jumped from just under $ 2 million in 2011 to $ 63 million in 2013 to $ 130 million last year , according to iri , a chicago-based market research firm . along the way , sazerac has cultivated a party-hearty social ethos around fireball , encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as #whiskywednesday . the brand has more than 85,000 followers on twitter and another 43,000 on instagram -- more than twice the social reach of jagermeister -- although on twitter , it still trails jack daniel 's whiskey and patron tequila . and it got a boost in october when someone taped a gopro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception . the resulting video has more than 2.3 million youtube views . \" our fans love it , and they spread the word . the fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing , \" said amy preske , public relations and events manager for sazerac , who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand 's booming popularity . \" we are very excited and humbled . \" so is fireball a future cornerstone of every well-stocked bar or just a fad ? it may be too soon to say . retail sales remain strong , according to iri , although fireball 's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months . but it 's under siege from several fronts . the past year has brought copycats jim beam kentucky fire and jack daniels tennessee fire , both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup , along with cinnamon vodkas , cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs . fireball also endured a public-relations mess last fall when several european countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients : propylene glycol , a chemical used in a variety of food products , e-cigarettes and antifreeze . sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in fireball \" in very small quantities \" -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the fda ( pdf ) -- and reassured customers that fireball is \" absolutely safe to drink . \" then there 's the question of whether fireball will become a victim of its own success . young consumers are notoriously fickle , and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it . \" it just reached a point where i could n't drink it anymore , \" said jones , the atlanta bartender . \" i think it was the sugar . \" still , its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather . glasses are raised , someone makes a toast , and down go shots of an orange , syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction . \" it 's an easy shot . you can drink a lot of them . with fireball , you do n't need a chaser , \" said kelvin davis , a bartender at the nook in atlanta . \" it 's the one thing i can throw out there and it never fails . \" the growth ... has just been astounding \"\n",

            "a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze will be introduced if the conservatives win the election . culture and media secretary sajid javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography amid fears that it is corroding childhood . he promised legislation to force distributors to put effective age verification technology in place that would apply to those based in the uk as well as abroad . easy access : the rising tide of online pornography is corroding children - but the tories have now pledged to a radical change in the law to protect a generation of children from the tide of internet sleaze if porn websites fail to comply , they will be blocked by a powerful new regulator which will be able to issue financial penalties . mr javid 's pledge is a victory for the daily mail 's long-running block online porn campaign . ministers have already persuaded internet service providers to start contacting all 19million uk households connected to the web and making them choose whether to apply family-friendly filters that block all porn sites . in addition , for any new broadband users , a block on pornographic websites is automatically applied by default . customers now have to specifically ask for this filter to be removed -- or to ` opt in ' -- in order to able to access adult material . but mr javid said a more radical crackdown was necessary to prevent children freely accessing pornography . ` even the most attentive and engaged parents can not know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they 're seeing , ' the minister told the mail . ` in 2015 anyone , regardless of their age , is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street . ` imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a dvd showing graphic , violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women , ' he said . ` yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images -- it 's happening online . ' mr javid , who is increasingly tipped as a potential future conservative leader , cited evidence that viewing hardcore porn can lead to children ` pressuring each other to try out things they 've seen , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos ' . ` it is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world -- magazines , tv , dvds or video-on-demand content . ` such protections are taken for granted , and , as the daily mail has argued for years , it 's time our approach to the online world caught up . ' mr javid said if the tories win next month ` we will legislate to put online hardcore pornography behind effective age verification controls ' . ` if websites showing adult content do n't have proper age controls in place -- ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material -- they should and will be blocked altogether , ' he added . an independent regulator will oversee the new system and determine how age verification controls will work . these are likely to involve similar software in place on gambling websites , which use credit card details or software to check passport details or driving licences to confirm users are over 18 . mr javid 's pledge is a victory for the daily mail 's block online porn campaign the regulator will also be given the power to require uk service providers to block specific websites identified as distributing hardcore pornography without effective age verification controls in place . it will have the power to issue targeted sanctions , including financial penalties . mr javid added : ` it is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline . if we fail to take action , there is every chance the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ` normal ' by the next generation . that is not the sort of society i want to see and certainly not the sort of society i want my children to live in . ' sarah green , of the end violence against women coalition , said the group ` warmly welcomed ' the proposals . peter wanless , of the nspcc , said : ` we do n't want children to learn about sex and relationships through the warped lens of adult pornography . ` this week we warned that ten per cent of children aged 12 and 13 were addicted to porn and one in eight had taken part in a sexually explicit video . any action that makes it more difficult for young people to find this material is to be welcomed . ' it 's time to protect children online by sajid javid , culture & media secretary , writing exclusively for mailonline imagine a 12-year-old-boy being allowed to walk into a sex shop and leave with a dvd showing graphic , violent sexual intercourse and the subjugation of women . you would , quite rightly , ask whether society should allow such a young mind to view hard-core pornography . i 'm sure we 'd all agree that the answer would be an emphatic \" no \" . yet each and every day children right across our country are being exposed to such images . and it 's happening online . the internet has been an amazing force for good in so many ways . but it also brings new threats and challenges for us to contend with . i 'm a father of four young children and i know all too well that the online world can be a worrying place for mums and dads . after all , even the most attentive and engaged parents can not know for sure which websites our children are visiting and what images they 're seeing . culture and media secretary sajid javid is setting out plans to shield youngsters from easy access to hardcore online pornography in 2015 anyone , regardless of their age , is only ever two clicks away from the kind of material that would be kept well away from young eyes in the high street . and allowing young people to access pornography carries alarming consequences both for individuals and for society . it can lead to children pressuring each other to try out things they 've seen online , and sharing inappropriate sexual pictures and videos . and it can lead to children having unhealthy attitudes towards sex and relationships . it is because of these types of concerns that we have long restricted and regulated adult content in the offline world -- whether that is magazines , tv programmes , dvds or video-on-demand content . such protections are taken for granted , and , as the daily mail has argued for years , it 's time our approach to the online world caught up . so today we are announcing that , if the conservatives win the next general election , we will legislate to put online hard-core pornography behind effective age verification controls . of course adults should be perfectly free to look at these sites . but if websites showing adult content do n't have proper age controls in place -- ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material -- they should and will be blocked altogether . no sex shop on the high street would be allowed to remain open if it knowingly sold pornography to underage customers , and there is no reason why the internet should be any different . an independent regulator will oversee this new system . it will determine , in conjunction with websites , how age verification controls will work and how websites that do not put them in place will be blocked . one thing is absolutely clear : the conservative party 's commitment to child safety online . for the past five years we have been working with industry on a voluntary basis , an approach that led to the creation of default-on family filters . but filtering is just one way in which we can keep our children safe online . now we can -- and must -- go further to give our children the best start in life . there will be some who say that this exercise is futile , that websites and children alike will find ways to get around this law . and i agree that there are always people who try to avoid legal restrictions . but we must not let the best be the enemy of the good . it is right that we act now and do what we can to restrict this content . it is right that we have the same rules applying online as we do offline . and it is right that we do everything we can to protect our children . if we fail to take action , there is every chance that the sort of things children see on these websites will be considered ` normal ' by the next generation . that is not the sort of society i want to see and it 's certainly not the sort of society i want my children to live in . over time britain 's laws have evolved to reflect our most deeply held values and beliefs , and the protection of children has long been a sacrosanct principle at the heart of that . i do n't believe that we should abandon such an important principle simply because the latest threat to our young people comes from a technology that also brings incredible benefits . there is a choice at this election , and it is between a party which backs families wants to give children the best start in life , and a chaotic labour party with no plan . we are clear : adults should and will be free to view legal content , but we would never stand by and allow that 12-year-old boy to buy hardcore pornography from a sex shop . it 's time to make sure our children are just as well protected online as they are on the high street .\n",

' i am proud of you . i 'm going to miss you . i am going to miss this building . i am going to miss this institution . more than anything , i am going to miss you all , ' holder told the standing-room-only crowd , many of whom embraced him after he concluded his speech . attorney general eric holder waved to justice department employees during his farewell gathering in washington on friday , ending six years at the doj holder shook hands and received hugs from well-wishers on his last day as attorney general newly confirmed attorney general-designate loretta lynch will take over from holder , following a months-long delay of her senate confirmation vote -- which passed on thursday with ` yes ' votes from 10 republicans the event also included a tribute video prepared for the occasion that featured members of congress , former president bill clinton and holder 's wife , sharon malone . in it , holder described an 'em otional attachment ' to the department and recounted efforts to protect civil rights , prosecute terror suspects in federal court and change the criminal justice system . other clips showed president barack obama showering holder with praise on the day holder announced his departure . holder , a former judge and u.s. attorney who took the job in 2009 , will exit the department as the third-longest serving attorney general in u.s. history . he has not publicly announced what he 'll be doing next . after lynch , 55 , is sworn in at the justice department on monday , she is likely to continue some of the same agenda as holder as the obama administration draws to a close . but she is expected to bring to washington her own management style and has spoken optimistically about having cooperative relationships with congress following years of bitter feuding with republicans who saw holder as overly political and once held him in contempt . holder 's tenure was in many ways defined by his efforts on civil rights protections . his department challenged state laws that it saw as restricting access to the voting booth and refused to defend the constitutionality of a federal law banning recognition of gay marriage . holder also pushed for changes in the criminal justice system , directing prosecutors to sharply limit their use of harsh mandatory minimum sentences and championing alternatives to prison for nonviolent drug defendants . though holder sees civil rights as a defining element of his legacy , his early years largely centered on national security concerns as the country confronted several terror plots , including a failed effort to blow up a detroit-bound airliner on christmas day in 2009 . mobbed : holder 's jubilant reception from his staff was the polar opposite of his treatment at the hands of congressional republicans media advocates criticized the justice department 's aggressive stance in news media leak investigations involving national security cases , and human rights groups expressed frustration when the department failed to bring charges over harsh interrogation tactics of terror suspects . one area where he has professed vindication is in his plan to transfer terror suspects from the guantanamo bay detention facility to the united states for prosecution in the federal court system . the plan was abandoned amid congressional opposition , but since then , the justice department has pointed to successful terror convictions in american courts even as the military tribunal system has slogged along without major results . on friday , he called that debate ` dead ' and settled and said it was now clear that civilian courts could adequately handle national security investigations .\n",

            "a southern new jersey woman jailed in an international custody dispute has been freed after spending more than eight years behind bars and is likely to be reunited with her daughter who 's been without either parent for nearly a decade . maría jose carrascosa , a 49-year-old native of spain , was released from jail friday night , the record reported . carrascosa , formerly of fort lee , was paroled last year after moving her daughter , then 5 , to spain when the girl 's father , peter innes , was granted custody of the child . freed : maría jose carrascosa was released from a new jersey jail on friday after spending nearly 9 years behind bars for refusing to return her daughter to the united states defiant : carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the united states and thus remained jailed nearly nine years once paroled , carrascosa was taken to the bergen county jail for contempt of court for violating a court order to bring the child back . her release came in part thanks to a letter written to the court by peter innes . superior court judge bonnie mizdol , ultimately deciding that incarceration would not coerce carrascosa to comply with child custody orders , ordered her release from jail friday . jail time for contempt of court is meant to coerce a person into cooperating with a judges orders , not as a punishment . however , carrascosa defiantly refused to bring her daughter back to the united states and thus remained jailed . ` the question before this court is whether incarceration has lost its coercive power and has become punitive , ' judge mizdol said . ` it has become clear that continued incarceration would not compel her to return her daughter , so it would be deemed punitive . ' during the hearing , the judge read a letter from innes , of hasbrouck heights , that said he would not oppose carrascosa 's release if she returns to spain to be with their daughter , victoria . the judge also read a letter from victoria , who is now 14 , that said : ` my only wish is to be with my mother . ' tearful reunion : carrascosa had a tearful reunion with her daughter via skype following her release and says she plans to return to spain as soon as possible finally : carrascosa 's release came after her daughter and estranged husband wrote letters to the court urging a judge to set her free this is what you 've been asking for and i am happy for you this day has finally come . you should know that i did all i could , including petitioning the judge , to help get your mom released . i did this so she can return to you in spain . please know , you mom is completely free to immediately leave the united states and return to spain . i truly hope she is with you tomorrow . for me , this conflict is over . i wish you and your family well and i hope you enjoy your reunion with your mother . i will always be here for you when the time comes that you want to hear the truth as i know it . pictured here at the start of their marriage , peter innes and maría jose carrascosa would end the union with a bitter divorce and battle over their daughter . last week , innes relented and chose to give his daughter what she wanted -- her mother back ' i am glad it is over and she is out , ' peter innes told the the record . ' i just hope she is on her way home to see our daughter . ' carrascosa moved her daughter to spain but continued the custody dispute in new jersey when she was arrested in 2006 . when a family court judge in bergen county ordered her to bring the child back within 10 days or go to jail , carrascosa refused , declaring that she would rather die in jail than bring her daughter back to new jersey . carrascosa was convicted in 2009 of willful interference with child custody , which resulted in the prison sentence . footage taken following her release friday by spanish language station rtve.es shows carrascosa sharing a tearful reunion via skype with her 14-year-old daughter . carrascosa told reporters she intends to return to her native spain , where in the last several years the case has gained widespread media attention and demands for her release , as soon as possible . ` my idea is to return to spain , to reunite with my daughter and my parents , and there , god will provide , ' carrascosa told reporters , though she said the arrangements for her return could take months of unraveling delicate legal issues . mr. innes did not attend the hearing and says his daughter has not spoken to him for several years . he told the record that he 's reached out to victoria , who lives in valencia , via email several times but has not received any response . ` my idea is to return to spain , to reunite with my daughter and my parents , and there , god will provide , ' carrascosa told reporters in an interview that followed her release innes runs a website named after his daughter in which he 's laid out his side of the drawn-out dispute . on the site , innes claims his ex-wife , an attorney by training , is a shady businesswoman with a habit of slandering him to anyone who will listen . innes even suggests carrascosa is mentally ill in addition to being an outright snob . ` her erratic and often delusional behavior suggest she suffers from psychiatric problems , ` she and her elitist and wealthy european family consider themselves above such \" common people \" like the innes family and above the laws of the united states . ' however , even innes seems to have come around on the issue of his ex-wife 's incarceration . in his letter to the court , he stipulated that he was unopposed to her release so long as she returns immediately to spain to be with their daughter . innes has updated his site since friday to reflect his ex-wife 's release with a letter to victoria explaining his role in the release .\n",

' taubman 's business success spanned from real estate and art houses to the hot dog-serving a&w restaurant chain , for which he traveled to hungary to figure out why the country 's sausage was so good . he also became a major backer of stem-cell research . but it was his rearrangement of how people shop -- parking lot in front , several stores in one stop close to home -- that left a mark on american culture . taubman centers , a subsidiary of his taubman co. , founded in 1950 , currently owns and manages 19 regional shopping centers nationwide . ` everything that excited me that i got interested in , i did , ' taubman told the associated press in a 2007 interview . born january 31 , 1942 , in pontiac , michigan , to german-jewish immigrants , taubman worked as a boy at a department store after school near his family 's home , which was among the custom houses and commercial buildings developed in the area by his father . he was a freshman at the university of michigan when he left to serve in world war ii , around the time he stopped using his first name , adolph . when he returned to ann arbor to study art and architecture , he created small on-campus businesses to cover expenses , then transferred to lawrence technological university near detroit to take night classes while working at an architectural firm as a junior draftsman . family business : taubman prestige outlets chesterfield officially opened in 2013 in chesterfield , missouri a western suburb of st. louis recognizing the booming post-war growth of the middle class , particularly in the motor city , he launched his first real estate development company in 1950 . his first project was a freestanding bridal shop in detroit -- but he had his eyes on something bigger . he 'd noticed shoppers responding to the convenience of ` one-stop comparison shopping opportunity , ' he wrote in his autobiography . so when a friend suggested a shopping plaza in flint , taubman 's company did something radical for the time : stores were pushed to the back of the lot and parking spaces were put up front . it was a success , his young company took on larger-scale developments in michigan , california and elsewhere in the 1950s and early '60s . a. alfred taubman is assisted as he leaves federal court in new york , on monday , april 22 , 2002 where taubman was sentenced to a year in jail for fixing commissions at sotheby 's taubman served as chairman of sotheby 's holdings , inc. , parent company of sotheby 's art auction house , from 1983 to 2000 , and was a partner in international real estate firm the athena group before he was tangled in a price-fixing scheme . he was convicted in 2001 of conspiring with anthony tennant , former chairman of christie 's international , to fix the commissions the auction giants charged . prosecutors alleged sellers were bilked of as much as $ 400 million in commissions . taubman was fined $ 7.5 million and spent about a year in a low-security prison in rochester , minnesota , but long insisted he was innocent and expressed regret for not testifying in his own defense . ' i had lost a chunk of my life , my good name and around 27 pounds , ' he recalled in his book , saying he was forced to take the fall for others . mall man : a. alfred , robert and william taubman , along with randy benderson and other dignitaries , cut the ribbon today to open the mall at university town center in sarasota , florida in 2014 the case cast a shadow over taubman 's accomplishments , but it diminished over the years -- and his philanthropy continued unabated . he had pledged $ 100 million to the university of michigan 's a. alfred taubman medical research institute and its stem-cell research by 2011 . he also financed public-policy programs at harvard , brown university and the university of michigan , which received several large donations . he donated millions and spoke passionately in support of the 2008 ballot initiative in michigan that eased restrictions on embryonic stem-cell research and enabled his namesake institute to conduct major research for diseases -- including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or lou gehrig 's disease , which claimed the life of his good friend , new york sen. jacob javits , in 1986 . after turning over control of taubman centers to his two sons , taubman made sustaining the detroit institute of art a priority . his knowledge of how shoppers negotiated malls was tapped to help reconfigure the flow of the museum , and he helped guide the dia as president of the detroit arts commission through chronic financial problems .\n",

            "student demonstrators who walked on an american flag to protest racism sparked a countermovement , prompting a south georgia university to cancel classes friday ahead of a rally that drew hundreds to valdosta . valdosta state university found itself in the center of a controversy after a video shared on social media showed an air force veteran and former playboy model , michelle manhart , taking an american flag from demonstrators who had walked on it to protest racism . at the protest , held a week ago , manhart was detained by police when she refused to return the flag . big rally : flag supporters attend a rally on friday in valdosta , georgia that caused the valdosta state university to close down for the day closed : uproar over a protest in which demonstrators walked on an american flag has prompted a south georgia university to cancel classes ahead of the rally expected to draw crowds of flag supporters to valdosta struggle : manhart , 38 , is shown , left , refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on . in the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at valdosta state university in georgia hunt : police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration , and they issued a warrant for eric sheppard 's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus she later was banned from the campus of 11,500 students . she was not a student at valdosta state , according to the school . the flag-walking demonstration involved three protesters , university spokesman andy clark said . meanwhile , tensions rose at valdosta state when campus police found a backpack containing a handgun on tuesday . police said they traced the gun to a protester who was part of the flag-walking demonstration , and they issued a warrant for eric sheppard 's arrest on charges of bringing a firearm onto a college campus . sheppard fled and has not been found by authorities , clark said . flag supporters gathered for a rally friday afternoon , and university administrators said the possibility of thousands of people rallying on the outskirts of campus ultimately led to the decision to give students a day off . ` that level of traffic and that many people will disrupt a lot of things in the city , ' clark said . ` we 're from an overall safety perspective looking to close the campus down today so they can have a peaceful rally . ' organizers of the ` flags over vsu ' rally said they expected as many as 4,000 people friday afternoon , walb-tv reported . university administrators arranged for extra police to be on campus to provide security during the rally , clark told the valdosta daily times . local law enforcement officials said the crowd that gathered was generally peaceful . pro-flag : a flag supporter waves a large american flag while attending a rally on friday in support of the flag in support : flag supporters on motorbikes attend a rally on friday in support of michelle manhart university administrators faced a backlash on social media after manhart was issued a criminal trespass warning , essentially banning her from campus . critics saw the university as siding with demonstrators who walked on the flag over a military veteran trying to save it . ` we were protecting their right to free speech and civil liberties ' without taking sides , clark said . nbc reports that some people t-shirts with the american flag and the words ` try walking on this flag ' written on the back and others carried signs . cover girl : after her original feature , manhart appeared in playboy again . she is shown here on the cover of the mexican edition nbc spoke with kim thompson who drove 30 miles to join in the rally . ' i think it 's going to be amazing . i think it 's actually going to be part of history , ' she said . thompson , the wife of a sailor , said that after september 11 she became more patriotic than ever and felt that she needed to speak up after watching the flag get trampled . michelle manhart , 38 , was handcuffed by police at valdosta state university , georgia , and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the stars and stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators last week . video footage of the event , last friday , shows manhart struggling with officers , who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go . it shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus , who demand their property be returned . in response , manhart says the flag belongs to ` the entire united states ' . campus police try to convince her to drop the flag , but manhart , a former training sergeant who served in kuwait , refuses . speaking to the valdosta daily times about her intervention , she said : ' i did not want anything like this , but i got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground , and they were walking on it . ' i was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground . i do n't know what their cause is , but i went to pick it up because it does n't deserve to be on the ground . ' she continued : ` if your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them . ` but to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom . you have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it . i 'm not fighting against them . i 'm fighting against the way they are going about it . ' cause : manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag , as seen above air force to bare force : manhart was once a staff sergeant at the san antonio air force training camp ( right ) , but was demoted when she appeared nude in playboy magazine . she is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread according to the daily times , the group did n't want to press charges against manhart . however , police gave her a trespass warning , which bans her from the campus . manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before . in 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for playboy magazine . explicit photographs from the periodical 's february 2007 issue show then-sergeant manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with , then later without - her military uniform . when air force bosses got wind of the racy feature , they relieved her of her duties at the lackland air force base in san antonio , texas . she was later demoted , and ultimately left the air force . however , she remained defiant , telling reporters at the time ' i did n't do anything wrong , so i did n't think it would be a major issue ' . the decision brought an end to 14 years of service she later appeared in other editions of playboy - including the cover of the mexican edition - and posed for animal rights group peta to support an anti-fur campaign . the daily times reported that manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on wednesday . in response to the incident , the university 's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest , but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose . dr william mckinney said : ` the american flag represents everything that is best about our country . as the supreme court has held , one of those things is the right to free speech , which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country . ` while i firmly disagree with the actions of the protesters , i understand their right to protest .

' mrs miliband said that she was ` furious ' when -- far from being ` unattached ' -- she found out that he was ` secretly going out with ' the woman who had invited her for dinner . fast-forward more than 11 years and the milibands have since had two children , married and believe they are less than a month away from moving house with their family to no 10 downing street . but the story of the pair 's first meeting offers a fascinating insight into the somewhat caddish character of the labour leader . for , not only did he knife his elder brother in the back by ending his dream of getting the labour leadership by standing against him ( contrary to the wishes of their mother ) , but he met his future wife justine ( albeit unwittingly ) at that dinner party hosted by his then girlfriend . the story emerged yesterday when mrs miliband gave an interview to the labour-supporting daily mirror . clearly she was guided by labour spin doctors , who wanted to give the impression to voters that her husband was a touchy-feely human being , rather than the soulless nerd that his awkward image conveys on tv . the simpering headline of the article ran : ` ed bandaged me up after i was bitten by a doberman ... and i fell in love . ' justine told how , during the 2005 election campaign , ed had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog . it happened when they were putting leaflets through letter-boxes in houses in runcorn , cheshire . ` ed bandaged me and i fell in love with him , ' said justine . former partners of mr miliband include juliet soskice ( left ) and fellow political aide liz lloyd ( right ) after their first meeting at that 2004 dinner party , it was at least a year before they started dating . justine 's recollection is n't , though , the first public airing of her love story with ed . in the biography of the labour leader , titled ed : the milibands and the making of a labour leader , an associate is quoted as saying : ` although she was struck by his eyes -- wide and brown and fixed on their subject -- a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting ed as : ` gosh , how fascinating , he 's really clever ' , rather than : ` gosh , how handsome ' . ' perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour , the daily mirror omitted to say that the dinner 's hostess , stephanie flanders ( who later left the bbc for a # 400,000-a-year job at a bank in the city ) , was ed 's then girlfriend . it was left to tony blair 's biographer john rentoul to let the cat out of the bag after reading the mirror story , when he tweeted : ` justine on clandestine ed . why has mirror not named the host of that dinner ? it was stephanie flanders . ' stephanie flanders ( pictured ) , a former girlfriend of mr miliband , hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife considering that she , at the time , was economics editor of bbc-tv 's flagship newsnight , rentoul added : ` could the secrecy have been because he was a treasury special adviser and stephanie flanders was a bbc economics journalist ? ' what 's more , there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics . for two years ago , ed miliband ungallantly blurted out , during an interview with a celebrity magazine , that not only had he romanced stephanie but that his close labour colleague and shadow chancellor , ed balls , had had a relationship with her , too . miliband said : ` we did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and ed . stephanie and i do n't have any problems running into each other now . ' for her part , stephanie had no forewarning of miliband 's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been ` very brief and a very long time ago ' . however , her relationship with balls , a decade earlier , was more serious . they met in 1989 at harvard university , where they were both kennedy scholars after having graduated from oxford university . it was while they were working at the financial times as leader writers that their friendship blossomed into a serious relationship . the way these relationships intertwined also highlights the deeply incestuous and narrow world of the labour high command . for it was n't just miliband and balls , but others , too , who had close personal relationships . of course , balls is now married to fellow shadow cabinet minister yvette cooper . all four studied politics , philosophy and economics ( ppe ) at oxford university . cooper and flanders were tutorial partners and kennedy scholars at harvard . miliband also studied at harvard . cooper once shared a house with miliband ( who apparently had a few other girlfriends ) . and she met balls when they both worked at the ft. but back to ed miliband 's tangled love-life . for several years in the mid-1990s , when he was working as an adviser to the then-shadow chancellor gordon brown , he went out with fellow political aide , liz lloyd ( a cambridge graduate ) . she worked for a time for tony blair , who described her in his memoirs as ` an english rose , intellectually able and blue stocking or red stocking according to the occasion ' . in the summer of 1995 , she and miliband went on holiday to the south of france . they stayed in the family home of one of miliband 's first girlfriends , juliet soskice ( the daughter of an lse political economist and who went on to marry the late tycoon andrew rosenfeld , who gave # 1 million to the labour party ) . at the time , juliet was dating the blairite journalist phil collins ( who went on to write speeches for blair ) . it was clearly a busman 's holiday , as much of the discussion among the group was about the national minimum wage which was a new labour policy . after breaking up with liz lloyd , mr miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist alice miles ( pictured ) ` we discussed it like we were in a fabian society seminar , ' recalled collins . ' i remember being in the kitchen and listening to ed having a conversation about it in real detail . ' miliband 's relationship with lloyd continued when blair became pm . her job at no 10 meant she sat next to her lover 's elder brother david miliband , who was a key figure in the downing street policy unit . after breaking up with lloyd , ed miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist alice miles , who then worked for the times . ms miles , who some years later became a single parent , also had a fling with her then coke-snorting times colleague tom baldwin , who is now miliband 's chief spin doctor . what a deliciously small and privileged world ! one that is a million miles from the lives of millions of ordinary voters . and so back to red ed and justine . the next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend stephanie flanders ' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an mp . later , she helped campaign for him in doncaster during the 2005 election by moving chairs around for a public meeting . no more mr nerd : justine 's interview in yesterday 's labour-supporting mirror some months after , justine planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend , quincy whitaker , to libya to see the roman ruins . however , after it was booked , justine said she wanted to go , instead , with ed miliband . their relationship had consolidated further by the time miliband was appointed secretary of state for energy and climate change in the brown government . not only had their personal lives meshed , but their professional ones , too , as justine ( who was a member of the labour party ) had written a book on the environment . a few years later they had the first of their two children -- and then decided to get married ( in may 2011 ) . this week , by happily putting the spotlight on her husband 's past love affairs , justine must be hoping that the result will be to portray him as a dashing romantic figure . however , many voters -- particularly women -- may see him in a less attractive light .\n",

            "in the end it took a mexican to end this utterly absorbing stand-off , the irrepressible , if rather unimpressive , javier hernandez scoring the goal that ended almost 180 minutes of deadlock between these fierce city rivals . only here on loan from manchester united for a season , it was a goal that means hernandez will be adored at the santiago bernabeu long after he has gone . but it was also a reward for ambition over the more conservative approach of diego simeone and his well-drilled side ; for the team that enjoyed twice as much of the ball and the better of the chances that were created in this tense , niggly champions league quarter-final tie . javier hernandez scores the only goal of the two legs in the champions league quarter-final between the madrid neighbours hernandez runs away to celebrate his goal as atletico madrid were finally beaten after almost two full matches against real madrid hernandez celebrates as he became the hero for real madrid late on during the champions league quarter-final second leg hernandez runs away in celebration after scoring the only goal in 180 minutes between the sides to settle the two-legged derby hernandez slides on his knees to celebrate putting real madrid into the semi-finals of europe 's elite competition at the bernabeu cristiano ronaldo joins in with the celebrations at the bernabeu as hernandez sneaked the winner against their neighbouring rivals ronaldo clenches his fists as he celebrates his side taking an all-important lead against their neighbours atletico madrid arda turan is sent off by german referee felix brych in the 76th minute as atletico madrid were forced to play with 10 men atletico madrid players protest the second yellow card shown to turan which left the visitors up against it at

siqueira , jimenez , torres booked : turan , raul garcia , koke sent off : turan ( 76 ) referee : felix brych ( germany ) 8 man of the match : kroos it was hard to see what atletico were trying to achieve at times . a victory on penalties perhaps . but when arda turan was dismissed in the 75th minute for what looked like a harsh second yellow card for a challenge on the all-too theatrical sergio ramos , an opportunity suddenly presented itself to real . a frustrated figure until atletico were reduced to 10 men , cristiano ronaldo made a jinking , purposeful run into the penalty area before executing the all-important pass . hernandez had missed his earlier chances . one of them a clear cut opening thanks to a wonderful reverse-pass from isco . but this time he delivered , the little pea scoring arguably the biggest goal of his career with a sweeping effort from 12 yards . in the starting line-up only because of an injury to karem benzema , hernandez performed much as he has all season here . committed and energetic but just lacking the class of his temporary club-mates . but with this contest only two minutes from moving into extra-time , goalless if far from gutless , hernandez made no mistake when it mattered most . ancelotti seems to beat atletico when it matters most . in last year 's champions league final . seven times already this season these two teams had met and seven times real had failed to conquer their less glamorous neighbours . but there is a reason why ancelotti is the only living manager to have lifted the european cup on three occasions , and today he is a significant step closer to winning the greatest club competition of all for an unprecedented fourth time . it might even secure his position at the bernabeu , given how uncertain his future appears to be despite delivering la decima last season . ` every game is an exam and tonight we passed the exam well , ' said the amiable italian with his trademark chuckle . what an extraordinary night it had been . as early as two hours before kick-off the streets around this magnificent stadium were packed with people , their rhythmic chanting rivalled only by the hum of the police helicopters hovering overhead . champions league nights between two teams from the same country have this special quality . rarely has an atmosphere been greater in english football than when chelsea travelled to anfield for that first semi-final back in 2005 . real madrid striker hernandez had been having a frustrating evening for real madrid up until his goal in the 88th minute hernandez could n't quite believe how he missed his chance to give real madrid the all-important lead at the bernabeu before his goal hernandez 's starting place for real madrid was described by local media as the ` biggest match of his career ' and he lived up to it but this was extra special . this was a madrid derby with a difference and the deafening roar that greeted the end of the champions league anthem said as much . you could barely hear yourself think never mind what the person sat next to you was saying , and it was no different when turan was dismissed and when hernandez then struck the decisive blow . for ancelotti it must have come as something of a relief after the tactical juggling he had to perform in the absence of key personnel . as well as benzema , gareth bale , luka modric and marcello were also missing and the decision to deploy ramos in midfield caused some concern here . after all , only once before had the italian tried it and after losing 2-1 to barcelona he admitted to making a mistake . afterwards he laughed about it too , joking that attempts to kill him last time had proved unsuccessful so he felt safe doing it again . this game quickly followed a familiar theme , with real pressing deep in the half of the well-drilled atletico . simeone , simmering and animated on the sidelines , applauded his players for the naughty challenges as well as the good ones , seemingly happy to see his side play so negatively . real madrid defender sergio ramos sends a powerful header towards goal but is unable to give his team the lead at the bernabeu ramos tries to encourage the crowd to make more noise at the bernabeu as real madrid tried to break the deadlock ramos goes down holding his face during the madrid derby at the bernabeu for the champions league quarter-final second leg ramos holds his face as german referee brych approaches to figure out what is wrong with the spain defender but the chances would come for real , with ronaldo forcing a fine save from the impressive jan oblak just before the break and hernandez failing to capitalise on that delightful ball from isco just after the restart . only when turan was dismissed did the breakthrough come , however , ronaldo and hernandez exploiting the slight tactical change simeone had been forced to make as a result of the red card . atletico 's manager said he had no regrets . ` i am proud of my players , ' he said . ` but congratulations to our rivals , who played a good game and scored a beautiful goal . ' a triumph for the beautiful game too . cristiano ronaldo rises to get his head to the ball above atletico madrid 's miranda ( centre ) and diego godin ( left ) during the tie ronaldo reflects after a missed chance during the real madrid vs atletico madrid tie in the champions league quarter-final second leg it proved a physical contest as usual between the madrid sides as ronaldo is pictured here complaining to the referee after a foul atletico madrid goalkeeper jan oblak had looked dominant between the sticks for the visitors as he fought for a cleansheet oblak allows the ball to go over his goal safely as atletico madrid tried to defend the attacks of their great rivals and neighbours real atletico madrid goalkeeper oblak dives to his left to make a save during the nervy champions league tie for both sides diego simeone ( left ) and carlo ancelotti embrace amid the madrid derby as both teams went head to head at the bernabeu the real madrid team bus was greeted by thousands of supporters outside the ground ahead of kick-off in the european tie fans showed their support for the real madrid squad as they arrived at the bernabeu for wednesday night 's match with rivals atletico this goal map shows how hernandez scored the only strike of the two legs ... click here for statistics , heat maps and more like this !\n",

28million defender , telling shaw that he was not fit enough to play for united , and replaced him with phil jones for the second half . arsenal went on to win 2-1 and getting dragged off at half-time was another blow to shaw 's fragile self-esteem . he has not played since , withdrawn by van gaal from the england squad for games against lithuania and italy because of question marks over his fitness . his position at united has been taken by daley blind , shuffled across from the centre of midfield as united went on a winning run against tottenham , aston villa , liverpool and manchester city . shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life , turning to united 's psychologist to declutter his mind and reboot just nine months into his career at old trafford . shaw is struggling to come to terms with his new life and has turned to united 's psychologist of late shaw had kept alex oxlade-chamberlain reasonably quiet in the fa cup clash but van gaal was unimpressed there are serious concerns , particularly because his parents have spoken to the club about a lack of structure and support for their teenage son . they have every right to do so . cash is king in football and we sometimes forget to look beyond the # 28m fee united paid southampton ( # 15m up front ) and a five-year contract worth an eye-watering # 90,000 a week . shaw was 19 in july , returning from england 's disastrous world cup in brazil , where he started the final group game against costa rica , to meet up with his new united team-mates . initially he lived in the lowry hotel , joined by his parents as he began a period of adaptation in a new city . he has since moved into a house in the suburbs . earlier this week he hinted at some of the difficulties he has faced , awarding himself a c minus for his first season during an interview with match of the day magazine . at united , shaw has found a manager in van gaal who has very specific and exacting demands of his players van gaal has led united up the table and they crowned the recent good form with a win over manchester city he was assigned a dietitian and given nutritional advice as he adjusted to life as the most expensive teenage footballer in the history of the game . at southampton he had been ordered to eschew the glasses of cola and sticky food , told to mature into his physique as he grew into a man 's body . he needs discipline and constant , caring reminders from the coaches . those close to him explain that shaw needs pastoral advice , that he responds positively when he feels close to the coaches and playing staff . at the age of 16 , when chelsea made an official offer for shaw in his breakthrough season at saints , his head was so scrambled by the prospect of joining his boyhood team that he had to be taken out of the southampton line-up . in the dog-eat-dog world of united , where it is a constant fight for survival after last season 's disappointing finish , he has yet to establish those strong bonds . last season he often spent time in mauricio pochettino 's office after training , sitting with the former southampton manager as they discussed different areas of their lives . mauricio pochettino spent a lot of time with shaw to help make him feel at home at southampton last season pochettino teased the best out of a player who went on to make his england debut at the age of 18 the club worked out that he was travelling back to his parents ' home near cobham , surrey , by monitoring his twitter account and looking at the times he posted messages on social media . with pochettino there was a real , almost paternal warmth to their relationship as the manager teased the best out of a player who went on to make his england debut at the age of 18 . to put shaw 's extraordinary rise into perspective , kenny sansom , perhaps england 's classiest and finest left back , had to wait until he was 20 to make his debut for the national team . shaw 's life has changed , moving away from the bosom of his family in surrey for the demands and challenges at a club where the spotlight is intense . he is a sensitive young man . it had been hoped that van gaal would show some patience with shaw when his appointment at united was confirmed , particularly after his champions league success at ajax in 1995 . marc overmars ( 22 ) , michael reiziger ( 22 ) and clarence seedorf ( 19 ) all started the 1-0 victory over milan in the final in vienna , with striker patrick kluivert ( 18 ) named on the bench . van gaal 's champions league success at ajax in 1995 saw him include young players in his starting xi at the 2014 world cup with holland , van gaal had notable success with 20-year-old memphis depay more recently , at the 2014 world cup with holland , van gaal had notable success with 20-year-old memphis depay , who was named on the three-man shortlist for the best young player at the tournament . but what shaw found at united was a manager who has very specific and exacting demands . before van gaal conceded defeat and reverted to a back four , shaw had been playing in the unfamiliar role of wing back . the transition has many similar characteristics to gareth bale 's first couple of seasons with spurs . both are real home boys . shaw 's position at united has been taken by daley blind , shuffled across from the centre of midfield the former southampton man is learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs around shaw longs for the days when he could stay behind after training with pochettino , where the argentinian coach would team up with one of the other young players for a light-hearted game of head tennis . it was at southampton , under the guidance of pochettino and the former executive chairman nicola cortese , where shaw 's career flourished . the well-being of the boy was top priority . he is a united player now , learning to deal with the attention at one of the biggest football clubs in the world . at such a young age , he needs all the help he can get .\n",

            "the duke and duchess of cambridge have moved back to kensington palace to prepare for the imminent birth of their new baby , mailonline can reveal today . the couple , whose second child is due on saturday , returned to their london base , just a few minutes ' drive from the private lindo wing at st mary 's , paddington , on sunday night after spending the weekend at kate 's family home in berkshire , where they took a trip to their local farm park . the news came as kensington palace revealed william will enjoy what amounts to six weeks ' paternity leave around the arrival of the new little prince or princess . reunited : prince william , pictured with his wife last month , has finished his air ambulance pilot training early so he is guaranteed to be with the duchess of cambridge when she goes into labour change : until today the second in line to the throne , who is a trainee pilot with the east anglia air ambulance in norfolk , had been expected to still be working around the time his wife is expecting their new baby . a royal spokesman announced that the second in line to the throne had completed his latest stage of his training as a pilot with east anglia air ambulance ( eaaa ) ` earlier than expected ' - and would not be required to embark on the final stage until june 1 . the future king had already announced that he planned to take two weeks ' statutory paternity leave after the birth . with his enforced absence from work happily coinciding with the birth of his second child , william will now take the next month and a half off as unpaid leave , aides said , with immediate effect . prince harry , pictured in australia , also announced today that he will be back in the uk to watch the london marathon on sunday , meaning he may also get to meet his future niece or nephew the palace also announced that prince harry , who is currently on deployment with the australian army , will briefly return to the uk this weekend to present the winners ' medals at sunday 's london marathon and , if all goes to plan , meet his new niece or nephew . harry -- who is soon to drop down a place in the line of succession to fifth -- is already travelling over to attend the gallipoli campaign centenary commemorations with his father , prince charles , on thursday . the prince , who is patron of the london marathon charitable trust , will return to australia on monday to continue his placement . the mail understands that in recent days the duchess , who carried out her last public engagement in march , has been taking her mind off the impending birth by spending a few days with her parents , michael and carole middleton , at their sprawling georgian mansion in bucklebury , berkshire . on sunday she and carole took her eldest son , prince george , for a visit to nearby bucklebury farm park where youngsters can meet a variety of animals from lambs to wild boar and enjoy a large outdoor playground . the little prince is a frequent visitor to the park with both his mother , nanny and grandmother . kate appeared unbothered by her pregnancy , according to onlookers , as she carried and cuddled george , accompanied by a low-key scotland yard security detail . the family returned to london on sunday night to make last minute preparations for the latest addition to their family , who will become fourth in line to the throne . in a statement today a kensington palace spokesman confirmed that william , who is employed by a private company , bond air services , while working for the eaaa , had sailed through his initial training so quickly that he would now be able to be with his wife both before and after the birth . plans : kate plans deliver her child at the lindo wing , where the cost of giving birth naturally is up to # 10,000 , and where their son george was july 2013 they said : ` the duke of cambridge has completed the first phase of his in-work air ambulance helicopter pilot training with bond air services earlier than anticipated . ` this is due to a combination of the duke performing well in the various modules and having very good flying conditions that allowed flight training and assessment to progress more quickly than had been planned . ' the duke was the first member of the royal family to take advantage of statutory paternity leave , which was introduced in the uk in 2003 . after the birth of his son george he took two weeks off while working on anglesey . with his second child due on saturday william will now be off work until june 1 , although it will be unpaid , palace sources say . government rules state fathers are paid # 139.58-a-week for a maximum of two weeks . it is understood the prince will not claim it . fathers are entitled to two weeks paid paternity leave and up to 26 weeks ' additional paid leave if the child 's mother returns to work . the spokesman explained that given the lengthy gap between now and the final stage of his training , the prince has been on unpaid leave since friday . he will undertake a handful of public engagements in late may , likely to include joining his grandmother , the queen , at a buckingham palace garden party , before recommencing his training at the start of the following month . his spokesman added : ` his final block of in-work training requires an uninterrupted three week block of working time and the availability of the new ec145 helicopter that will be used for missions . this has always been scheduled to commence on 1st june , following a pre-planned period of official royal engagements in late may , details of which will be announced in due course . ` as he now will not have any further training to complete after returning from paternity leave , he will not return to duties with bond until that time , and will remain on unpaid leave until then . ' while it is unlikely the new little prince or princess will become monarch , it is not unheard of . the queen 's own father became george vi after the abdication of his elder brother , edward viii , over his love for american divorcee wallis simpson . the current monarch celebrated her 89th birthday quietly with her husband , prince philip , at windsor castle where she is holding easter court . not only has she now entered her 90th remarkable year , but the queen will soon also become the longest reigning monarch in british history .\n",

            "faris al-khori , 62 , was found with a hoard of explosive ingredients and recipes for bombs in his flats a former syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home . faris al-khori had dozens of chemicals , poisonous materials , bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb , a court heard . the equipment was found purely by chance in april last year after a fire at a block of flats in the muirhouse area of edinburgh . firefighters , who were responding to a 999 call over a fire within a rubbish chute on the 11th floor , had forced entry to a flat registered to al-khori and found jars containing various powders . castor beans , which can be used to make ricin , were also found . the building was evacuated while the police and army explosive ordnance device ( eod ) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old . al-khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the forensic explosives laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed . a search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in leith and a further haul of material was recovered . both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off . al-khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in february he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act . police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit ( pictured ) from the properties two coleman 's mustard jars were found being used to store a small amount of a highly volatile explosive , lead picrate sentencing him to three years and four months in prison , judge lady wolffe said : ` you assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area . ` the number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence . ' the court heard that much of the bomb-making equipment , which also included electrical circuits , had been ordered from online retailers . defence qc brian mcconnachie said : ` what seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies , mainly through amazon . ` the material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to mr al-khori . ` it has always been done in the open and over a period of time . many of the items have never been opened . al-khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 explosive substances act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients ` it is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials . ` it seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything . ' detective superintendent david gordon , who led the investigation , said : ` this was a significant and complex inquiry for police scotland , to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish al-khori 's motives for storing them . ' a thorough investigation by the organised crime and counter terrorism unit and crown office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe faris al-khori was acting independently . however , he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings . ` thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the fire service and armed forces , we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion . the items from the flats in edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered ' i am also grateful to the city of edinburgh council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches . ` public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public . ` al-khori 's activities went unnoticed for many years , demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep scotland safe . ` counter terrorism is one of police scotland 's highest priorities , and whilst al-khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified . ' al-khori , who was born in damascus and raised in a christian family , trained as a doctor in iraq but has never practised medicine in britain after arriving here in 1984 . he was the full-time carer for his wife , who suffers from schizophrenia , and has had british citizenship since 1998 . police and army explosive ordnance device ( eod ) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials lindsey miller , the crown office 's procurator fiscal for organised crime and counter-terrorism , added : ` the conviction of al-khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public . ` al-khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives . ` we worked closely with police service of scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that al-khori was brought to justice . ' ' i want to reassure the people of scotland that we take any such offences extremely seriously , and our specialist prosecutors will continue to treat them as an absolute priority . '\n",

' mr doyle , who was sent this get well soon card by pupils , said he plans to continue his job as a lollipop man despite being injured by rustemi speaking of the incident , he said : ' i had dropped my lollipop down to draw the driver 's attention to the fact i was in the middle of the road with two schoolchildren . ` but he was only about 18 inches away from me as he went by . he asked me what the bloody hell i thought i was doing . i said , \" did n't you see me standing on the road ? \" he said \" no \" so i said , \" you should bloody well open your eyes then . \" rustemi tried to argue that mr doyle had been the ` aggressor ' during the incident , but police took statements from a number of schoolchildren witnesses who said the opposite ` he drove off and i thought that was it then three or four minutes later he came charging across the road towards me and hit me in the side . much to my mortification i collapsed . ' i have never experienced anything quite like that . it was just not being able to stand up at again . i was lying on the floor and could n't stand up . i had to crawl across the pavement to a wall and hauled myself up against it and by this time i had people around me . i did n't think there was proper injury at that point , i was just deeply ashamed that i had fallen and could n't stand up again . ` it was n't until later in hospital having an x-ray they discovered that i had broken my rib . i ca n't imagine anybody would drive away , park the car and come charging back because of a sudden burst of temper . this must have been something that was festering for one reason or another . ' sentencing him the judge mr recorder david heaton qc said : ` you behaved in a way in front of your daughter and in front of other schoolchildren which is repugnant to right-minded people . you drove along the road and it appears you failed to see mr doyle , the school crossing patrol man , who at that time was escorting two 12-year-old girls across the road . ` so frustrated was he by your driving that he , perhaps unwisely , allowed his crossing banner to drop on to your vehicle and no doubt that surprised your daughter and caused you to exchange words with him . if matters had rested there i imagine you would not be here . foolishly , you went away but returned two minutes later , more angry , it appears , than you were previously , and threw a punch at mr doyle . ` he was carrying out a public service escorting schoolchildren safely from one side of the road to the other and is a much older man . i am prepared to accept you did not realise at the time but nonetheless an inexcusable feature was his age . ` the service he performed is one which parents of children up and down the country value every morning of the school term . you assaulted a public servant , you did it in front of children in the morning and to a man who was significantly older than you . i note you have not been well and that might be some sort of explanation for this extraordinary behaviour .

back and forth . they realized they were falling in love . for most other couples , the next step would be to meet in person . but for katie and dalton , that was complicated -- and dangerous . cystic fibrosis patients should n't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs . dr. michael anstead at the university of kentucky , katie 's pulmonologist since she was a little girl , had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other cf patients were a bad idea . in their online conversations , one of the first things dalton told katie about himself was that he had burkholderia cepacia , a horribly dangerous infection for people with cf. \" i was like , ` hi , i 'm dalton from missouri and i have burkholderia cepacia , ' because it 's such a big deal in the cf community , \" he remembers . \" i left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her . \" katie listened to her heart , even if it might hurt her lungs . she asked dalton to come visit her in flemingsburg , kentucky . \" i told dalton i 'd rather be happy -- like really , really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years , \" katie says . \" that was definitely something i had to think about , but when you have those feelings , you just know . \" so on august 28 , 2009 , dalton drove more than six hours from st. charles , missouri , to katie 's hometown in flemingsburg , kentucky , where they 'd arranged to meet at the dairy queen . at 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- katie got out of her car and saw dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses . \" my heart was racing , but i just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello , \" she remembers . \" i 'm usually not that kind of girl , but it just felt so right . \" katie took dalton and his mother , renee , who 'd made the trip with him , to have dinner with her and her parents , debbie and john donovan . later the young couple drove around flemingsburg , and dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday , which was two days before . their health quickly deteriorated , and within months , the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time . too ill to work , dalton quit his job at his family 's auto repair shop , and katie quit hers as a store clerk . in august , 2014 , the couple entered the university of pittsburgh medical center together to wait for new lungs . dalton 's came first , and on november 17 , he had his transplant . despite his burkholderia cepacia , which makes transplants more complicated , it was a success . \" i was so thrilled . i was so happy for him , \" katie says . the month after dalton 's surgery , upmc discharged katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while . when she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital , but upmc informed her she 'd used up her supply of medicare days and would n't accept her . medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- would n't pay for another hospitalization until katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days . but katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days , much less sixty . so katie relied on medicaid , public insurance that was supplied by her home state of kentucky . she was admitted to the university of kentucky hospital , where she was cared for by anstead , her beloved pulmonologist . but then , another hurdle . anstead explained that most lung transplant centers , including the two in kentucky , do n't do transplants on patients with burkholderia cepacia , referring them to larger centers like upmc that have more experience with such complicated cases . katie and dalton , now 24 and 23 , were desperate . her doctors predicted she would n't live a year without new lungs . going on her husband 's private insurance was n't an option , since dalton is on his father 's policy . in february , anstead wrote a letter to medicaid , pleading with them to make an exception and pay for katie 's care at upmc , even though it was out of state . kentucky medicaid denied his plea , and that 's when the squabbling began . in a statement to cnn , a spokeswoman for the kentucky cabinet for health and family services pointed the finger at upmc , saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a kentucky medicaid provider . \" medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations , \" wrote the spokeswoman , gwenda bond . \" should upmc reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a kentucky medicaid provider , the department for medicaid services ... will be happy to expedite their application . \" upmc counters that kentucky medicaid told them that if they want to care for katie , they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept kentucky medicaid patients . while upmc spokeswoman wendy zellner did n't elaborate , a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low . asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take kentucky medicaid is \" an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state medicaid programs , \" zellner wrote . \" upmc wants to help katie , and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen ... it is up to kentucky medicaid to address this situation . \" today , katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed , hoping that the three parties -- medicare , medicaid , and upmc -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs . \" i feel like they 're putting a dollar sign on my life , \" she says . \" i do n't want to die because of money . nobody should have to do that . \" if katie does n't get her transplant , not only will she die , but she 'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection , which could be deadly for him as he 's on drugs to suppress his immune system . as a result of inquiries from cnn , on wednesday aaron albright , the director of the media relations group at the centers for medicare and medicaid services arranged for a caseworker to call katie at the hospital . but it did n't go very well . katie says the caller , who identified herself as pat pierorazio , was \" rude , mean , and angry . \" \" she said someone had told her to call me , and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me , \" she says . katie says the medicare representative told her she would look into her situation . in a statement , albright with cms wrote to cnn : \" we are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs . cms is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as possible . \" caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance , katie tries to stay strong , just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first facebook conversation . skyping with dalton helps , and raising money on their facebook page keeps her mind busy . and she 's always thinking about their \" after transplant bucket list , \" which they keep in a safe in their house so it wo n't be destroyed by fire or flood . on the list : drive through every state . learn another language and visit a country where they speak it . write a book together about their love story . they have simpler dreams as well . like going grocery shopping together , or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television . and this is their biggest goal : \" i just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in july and be able to hold hands and just hug . that 's all i really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary , \" she says . wednesday afternoon , there were signs of hope . zeller , the upmc spokeswoman , sent an email to cnn . \" ky medicaid has reached out to us to talk . so stay tuned , \" she wrote . katie and dalton were glad to hear it . \" i do n't care what i have to do to get her lungs , \" dalton said . \" i will just keep trying until there 's nothing left to try . \"\n",

            "flight cancellations soared by 20 per cent and delays by 7 per cent in the first quarter of 2015 . uk passengers faced more holiday chaos than during the same period last year , according to analysis from flight data specialist euclaim . in the first four months of the year , there have so far been 5,080 flight cancellations , compared to the 4,239 cancellations during the same period in 2014 . according to flight data specialist euclaim , cancellations and delays are on the rise so far this year over last the number of delays also increased to 2,427 from 2,260 in 2014 . it 's low-cost carrier monarch that has seen the greatest increase in delays so far , with passengers suffering 64 incidents compared to 47 during the same period of time last year . that 's an increase of 30 per cent . and easyjet has n't fared much better , experiencing a 19 per cent increase in delays . during last year 's first quarter , there were a reported 206 hold-ups , while this year has already seen 245 . however , airlines are refuting the figures . a spokesperson fro monarch said : ` the recent media report in regards to the on time performance during the first quarter of this year is incorrect and misleading . ` for clarity , during the first quarter of 2015 we experienced winter weather across europe which has been far worse than the same period last year , which particularly affected our operation to and from france , as well as the recent the french atc strike which affected many carriers across europe . it should be noted that during this time frame monarch airlines ' did not cancel any flights . ` in the event of strikes or weather disruption , the business model of many other airline carriers is to cancel services ; which will protect their on-time performance , but of course have a negative impact on their customers . ` monarch airlines will only cancel flights if there is absolutely no viable way of operating that flight thus placing the highest value on getting customers to their destination as opposed to protecting our on-time performance by tactically cancelling our flights . ' low-cost carrier monarch has fared the worst so far in 2015 , experiencing a 30 % increase in delays despite all the hold ups , it 's been a good year for thomas cook , which has reduced its delays by 37 % but it may not be entirely the fault of the airlines . british airways - 11 % decrease thomas cook - 37 % decrease winter weather across europe this year has been far worse than the same period last year and has particularly affected jet2 , easyjet and monarch 's routes to chambery and grenoble in france . similarly , delays and cancellations could also be attributed to a number of strikes on the continent . the four-day lufthansa strike in march resulted in some 116 cancellations of flights to the uk . strikes by italian air traffic controllers and security staff in germany also compounded such a problem . still , despite the external factors , it 's been a good year for thomas cook , which has reduced delays by 37 per cent , and british airways also saw an 11 per cent reduction in stoppages . monarch airlines contests the euclaim figures , however , telling mailonline travel that ` their source of information is questionable . ` they claim that their data comes directly from the aircrafts on board acars and ads-b systems , but monarch airlines use neither of these . ` the reason that our otp figures appear higher than other airlines is due to the fact that we have not cancelled any flights . ` we put our customers before our otp and would rather operate with a delay than not at all .

' when the plane landed , skywest initially claimed that the aircraft landed ` out of an abundance of caution ' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane . late on wednesday , the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that ' a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight ' . on landing this was declared untrue and skywest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight . skywest spokeswoman marissa snow said : ` there were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent , but i ca n't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill . ' skywest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft . nose dive : emergency vehicles surround a skywest airlines plane , operating as united express , that made an emergency landing at buffalo niagara international airport on wednesday flight 5622 , from chicago to hartford , made an emergency landing in buffalo passenger , dave barkley , 46 , told the la times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious . suddenly , the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over detroit . ` they said there was a pressure problem with the plane , ' he said . ` there was no door flying open or anything like that . it was something very gradual . ' barkley said that while the passengers were calm , he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made . ` the way skywest is reporting it is that someone got sick , and they had to land , ' he told the la times . ` but the way we understand it , they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane . ' a nurse flying on the embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out . it was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks . ` the passenger was lethargic . she was responding but her color was off . she did n't look good . we got her some oxygen . she was much more alert after getting the oxygen , ' the nurse , mary cunningham , tells nbc connecticut . cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better . it was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out , as well . then cunningham , herself , took a turn . passengers arriving at buffalo niagara international airport react to the group of media gathered to report on a skywest airlines plane that made an emergency landing after one passenger aboard flight 5622 lost consciousness and the pilots rapidly descended ` out of an abundance of caution .

' passenger larry johnson said , ' a lot of people with their heads down praying . it just felt like a re-enactment . ' while another passenger said , ` you could just feel something in the air , something just was n't quite right . ' for nearly eight minutes , the plane descended at a very steep incline , dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute , while flying over lake erie , flight tracking service flightaware said . the flight originated in chicago and had been bound for bradley international airport in windsor locks , connecticut . it landed at buffalo niagara international airport in buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. skywest inc. , which is based in st. george , utah , said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released . an additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing , but none required treatment outside the airport , airport spokesman c. douglas hartmayer said . ` anyone who said they did n't feel well was treated at the gate , ' he said . ` we want to understand the circumstances and what skywest knows before we decide what , if any , action we would take , ' said kelly nantel , spokeswoman for the national transportation safety board . snow said the plane 's oxygen masks did not release . according to wkbw , one passenger said the plane ` nosedived ' and crew told fliers that there was a loss of cabin pressure , but that turned out not to be true . skywest has 29 embraer 175s in its fleet . the aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants . in a statement , the faa said : ` skywest airlines flight 5622 , an embraer e170 aircraft , landed safely at buffalo international airport at 11.40 am after the crew declared an emergency . ` the faa will investigate .

            "( cnn ) the hillary clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the clinton family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called \" clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich \" by peter schweizer , coming out may 5 . my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt team clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to bill clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state hillary clinton . it 's not that the alleged conflicts are n't potentially serious ; as i recently noted in these pages , they are . according to the wall street journal , in 2014 the clinton foundation \" received money from the united arab emirates , saudi arabia and oman , among others . the donors included canada 's foreign affairs department , which is promoting the keystone xl pipeline . \" that 's the same keystone xl pipeline from canada that the state department all but endorsed , concluding after a five-part analysis that ran to 17,000 pages that the project 's environmental impact would be minimal . president obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it 's legitimate to ask whether the donation from canada directly or indirectly influenced the state department 's analysis . and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the u.s. government were donors to the clinton global initiative , a sister group that was spun off from the clinton foundation . cnn 's alexandra jaffe wrote last month that \" listings for the clinton global initiative 's annual meeting found partnerships with at least six banks that were under investigation , involved in litigation or had been fined by government agencies and regulators at the time of the meeting . in every case , the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media . \" those are serious matters -- but so are stubborn unemployment , troubled schools , high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters ' concerns . a bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild haiti . even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to clinton charities , noted jaffe , \" there 's no indication the clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation 's efforts . \" that does n't leave much room for outrage . a more serious critique of the clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less-than-flattering light . in a well-known case of deception , a con man named raffaello follieri charmed his way into the foundation 's good graces , earning public praise from bill clinton for promising $ 50 million to the clinton global initiative -- money that never materialized . a more serious problem developed internally , with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities . in 2007 and 2008 , the foundation ran a $ 40 million deficit and in 2012 had an $ 8 million deficit . so we already knew that the clintons ' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor . it 's distasteful , but by now it 's not news . unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the clintons ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about hillary clinton 's use of private emails to conduct state department business . according to a recent poll by the rightward-leaning rasmussen -- taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news -- a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57 % expect clinton to win the presidency . no wonder clinton seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book . \" we 're back into the political scene , and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and i 'm ready for it , \" she said in new hampshire . calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest \" distractions \" suggests that clinton knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities .\n",

' when the child said ukip , mr hunt replied , ` very good ' and asked why . the youngster replied : ` to get all the foreigners out the country .

            "the family of a former civil servant have spoken of their fury after he left his # 1million estate to turkish carer nermin kancefer ( above ) , who he met just 14 months before he died the family of a former civil servant have spoken of their fury after he left his # 1million estate to a turkish carer he met just 14 months before he died . dennis sears changed his will to leave everything to live-in home help nermin kancefer months after she moved in to his # 615,000 flat . he disinherited his surviving relatives who had been the intended beneficiaries for more than 20 years . four months later , he died at the age of 87 . his family claimed the carer exploited the ` vulnerable ' childless widower , who had parkinson 's disease and was in poor health . but the mother-of-one , 50 , insists mr sears had a change of heart after falling out with his family . mr sears 's family challenged the will but agreed a # 50,000 settlement in august after they were told legal costs in the case could reach six figures . his nephew peter harris , 49 , told the mail the family had always got on well with the various carers mr sears had following his wife kath 's death in 2009 . but he claimed within months of miss kancefer 's arrival she was calling him ` daddy ' and they felt ` something was not right ' . he said mr sears ` suddenly ' turned on his nephews and niece , accusing them of conspiring to put him into a nursing home . he instructed solicitors to serve harassment notices to prevent them contacting him . four months after she moved in , in february 2012 , mr sears paid # 3,000 to buy miss kancefer out of her agency contract so she could work for him privately . he also gave her rings which had belonged to his wife of 40 years . he changed his will in august 2012 leaving the bulk to charity and some to miss kancefer , but changed it again in december that year leaving everything to her . his estate included his three-bedroom riverside flat in walton-on-thames , surrey , and # 400,000 in shares and cash . mr harris said he and his four siblings visited their uncle -- whose late wife was their mother 's sister -- once a month and he had spent christmas with their family for decades . he added : ` we built a rapport with dennis 's carers to ensure he was happy and well cared-for . this all changed suddenly when nermin appeared on the scene . we were incredibly close , he was ensconced in the family . ` all of a sudden there was a dramatic change in his behaviour . she convinced him we wanted to put him in a home and were only after his money . it was so far from the truth . our only concern was for dennis 's welfare . ' he said fighting the will had been ` difficult ' as his uncle was proved to have been of sound mind when he changed it . ` we just want people to know the warning signs so this does n't happen to anyone else , ' he added . dennis sears ' estate included his three-bedroom riverside flat in walton-on-thames , surrey ( above ) , and # 400,000 in shares and cash miss kancefer strongly denied any wrongdoing and said mr sears was ` extremely happy ' with her . she said he was ` angry ' with his relatives and it was his decision to disinherit them . she told the mail : ' i had a special connection with dennis . he gave me love like i never had from my father . ' she added : ` when i found him he was in a very bad condition but he really recovered and was enjoying life . ' she claimed she did n't find out about mr sears 's second will change until after he died . asked why she thought he left everything to her , she said : ` because he was looked after very well . ' she said mr sears had felt ` bullied ' by his relatives . ` if he was unhappy why should he leave it to them , ' she said , adding : ` if my son does not treat me well i will do the same . ' surrey police fraud officers were investigating the case but yesterday made the decision to take no further action .\n",

            "chatting happily and smiling during a peaceful walk in the grounds of their scottish country home , they could be any long-married couple enjoying a stroll . but this is the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall and the intimate shot marks not 40 years of marriage but 10 . the couple , who married a decade ago at the windsor guildhall , are spending their anniversary privately at birkhall in deeside . portrait of a happy marriage : charles and camilla in the new photo released to mark their 10th anniversary big day : the prince of wales and the duchess of cornwall on their wedding day a decade ago birkhall , which sits on the queen 's balmoral estate , was the location for their honeymoon and was also the venue for their first anniversary celebrations . the new image , which is the work of top photographer oliver dann , was taken in the run-up to last month 's visit to the u.s but was released by clarence house today . in it , charles wears a country coat made from inveravon estate tweed and a matching hat by lock & co , while camilla sports a hat by the same firm and a coat by moncler . charles and camilla finally married following a relationship spanning 35 years in a relatively quiet civil ceremony at the windsor guildhall on the 9th april 2005 . despite fears that the couple would be booed - camilla was reportedly so nervous that she had to be dragged out of bed - the ceremony went off without a hitch . since then , the duchess of cornwall as she is now known , has become an integral part of the royal family - and would be cheerfully accepted as charles ' queen by 50 per cent of britons . that marks a significant turnaround from the duchess ' earliest days as a royal , with camilla following charles ' lead and often appearing nervous in front of photographers . but her enthusiastic championing of causes ranging from osteoporosis to sexual abuse survivors has not gone unnoticed and her relationship with the queen is now said to be close . ` her role has changed dramatically , ' explains royal biographer penny junor . ` one minute she was a mistress and then she was an hrh . ` when she first married charles she was very nervous . on her wedding day , she was terrified . she had no idea if she would be booed in the street . ` in fact , there was a very warm reception . the streets were packed in windsor . she has slowly gained courage and confidence . initially she was very much in the background , supporting the prince and she still does that . ` she 's never had any ambition for herself . she did n't want to be a princess or a duchess . she just happened to love a man who was the prince of wales and look at the fuss that caused . she does n't want to be a star or be curtseyed to . happy : the pair are all smiles as they arrive at the british ambassador 's residence in washington last month charles and camilla pictured enjoying a dram during a visit to birkhall last summer ` but slowly , slowly she has become much more involved in royal life and taken on an awful lot of charitable causes . ' the duchess is now patron or president of 85 charities , joint patron or president with the prince of four , and is affiliated to a number of other organisations . ms junor added : ` it 's really , really valued by those charities . having been a woman who up to her mid-50s had been a wife and a mother and a country woman who enjoyed horses and dogs , she 's completely reinvented herself and become an ambassador for the country . ' in 2013 , camilla made her first ever appearance at the state opening of parliament wearing a glamorous champagne silk and lace bruce oldfield gown . the duchess , whose presence was seen as a boost for charles , topped that with the queen mother 's priceless boucheron tiara and the dame grand cross of the victoria order sash . she returned for the 2014 state opening as well and is expected to return once again for this year 's event . close : prince william and the duchess of cornwall share a joke during last september 's invictus games support : the queen shares a carriage with camilla during the diamond jubilee celebrations in 2012 one is amused : camilla laughs with prince harry and the duchess of cornwall during the diamond jubilee similarly styled : the duchess ' dress sense has also evolved over the last 10 years and is much like her daughter-in-law 's the duchess has also carried out joint engagements with the queen and in november hosted a reception on behalf of the monarch for the commonwealth essay competition . during the diamond jubilee in 2012 , the queen and camilla sat side-by-side in the ornate 1902 state landau - a step that would have been inconceivable a decade earlier . the duke of edinburgh had fallen ill and the prince of wales and camilla stepped in to ride with the monarch in the carriage procession back to buckingham palace . but it was camilla , not charles who was seated next to the jubilee queen . she was present too on stage , standing next to the sovereign , as charles paid tribute to his mother at the finale of a pop concert in front of the palace . during the golden jubilee concert in 2002 , prior to her marriage to the prince , camilla was seated several rows behind charles . on charles and camilla 's seventh wedding anniversary in 2012 , the queen made the duchess a dame grand cross of the royal victorian order ( gcvo ) - a personal seal of approval from the monarch . ' i do n't think that the queen has ever had any personal animosity to camilla . in the eighties and nineties when charles and diana were at each other 's throats , camilla was seen to be the cause and it threatened to destabilise the monarchy , ' says ms junor . ` the queen has always been fond of camilla . she knew her for years and years , long before she was involved in the break up of the marriage . ' she added : ` the queen reacts to public opinion . once the public were going to accept camilla , the queen was able to accept her publicly . ` they 've got a great deal in common . they 're mad about horses , dogs . they 're country women . ' when camilla married charles , aides insisted she did not want to be known as queen when the prince acceded to the throne but intended to be known as princess consort instead . but according to some legal experts , unless there is change in the law , camilla will technically become queen when charles is king - no matter what she decides to call herself . at the time of her engagement to the prince in 2005 , a poll showed that only seven per cent of people believed camilla should one day be queen . happily married : charles has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since his marriage close : the duchess has always known how to make charles laugh and he ` adores her ' in return royal duties : with half of britons supporting the idea , it is increasingly likely that camilla will become queen a decade later , half of all britons say she should become queen when charles takes the throne according to a poll by yougov . a third think she should be given a lesser title out of sensitivity to diana , princess of wales and 16 per cent were unsure . when the prince was put on the spot and asked if camilla would be his queen in an interview in november 2010 , he replied : ` that 's , that 's , we 'll see , wo n't we ? that could be . ' ' i think there 's still a hard core of people out there who want nothing to do with camilla and think she 's the devil incarnate but the vast majority think she 's a good thing , ' adds ms junor . ` she is familiar now as any member of the royal family . it would be very strange if she were not called queen . ' i think she will be embraced and think the public will have no problem with it whatsoever . charles is hugely proud of her and she 's so important to him . he wants her by his side - that 's an absolute given . ' born camilla rosemary shand on the 17th july 1947 , the duchess of cornwall 's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones . the daughter of major bruce middleton hope shand and his wife rosalind , the duchess was born in london but spent much of her childhood in sussex along with her siblings , annabel and mark . according to her biographer giles brandreth , her upbringing , although not royal , was certainly a grand one . ` camilla is often described as having had an \" enid blyton sort of childhood \" , ' he writes . ` in fact , it was much grander than that . ` the shands had position and they had help -- help in the house , help in the garden , help with children . they opened their garden for the local conservative party association summer fête . after a stint at a swiss finishing school , camilla burst onto the london social scene as a debutante on the 25th march 1965 . but it was n't all fun , with the future duchess of cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of london firms to pay for her belgravia flat , which she shared with lady moyra campbell . in the late 1960s , camilla met the man who was to become her first husband , cavalry officer andrew parker-bowles , with the couple dating off and on for several years - with mr parker-bowles striking up a relationship with princess anne at one point . camilla , meanwhile , had struck up a relationship with prince charles , who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971 . when the couple split following an overseas posting for charles in 1973 , camilla reconciled with parker-bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year . tom in 1974 and laura in 1978 . but it was her continuing relationship with prince charles that would come to define her , with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people . in 1992 , claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when diana : her true story was published , followed , a year later by the ` camillagate ' scandal . by 1995 , both marriages had come to an end and charles and camilla were unofficially back together , with the future duchess often seen attending events with the prince . royal acceptance soon followed with the queen making camilla part of the golden jubilee celebrations in 2002 . a year later , the duchess moved into clarence house and on the 10th february 2005 , charles and camilla 's engagement was announced . the couple married just under two months later in windsor , with camilla taking the title of the duchess of cornwall .\n",

' he added : ` it is rooted in darkness and starts with a murder , which spreads its shadow over many of the principal characters . ' the novel tells the story of doctor thomas thorne , who lives in the village of greshamsbury in barsetshire with his beautiful niece , mary , a girl blessed with every gift except money . mary has grown up alongside the gresham sisters -- augusta , beatrice and alexandrina -- and their handsome brother frank , whose home is the great house and estate at greshamsbury park . when the terrifying lady arabella gresham discovers that her son frank has fallen in love with doctor thorne 's penniless niece , she is horrified . and the situation is made all the more fraught because doctor thorne is harbouring a secret about mary 's parentage which threatens to bring everyone 's world crashing down . trollope 's tale is considered one of his best works and fellowes 's track record in both television and film is likely to attract an a-list cast . tv insiders say hugh bonneville , who plays lord grantham in downton , and lily james , who plays lady rose in the show and who stars in the new disney cinema hit cinderella , would be ideal as thomas thorne and mary . but one source last night said that itv would be keen to ensure that the cast of the new drama was not filled with faces from downton . tv critics want hugh bonneville , who plays lord grantham in downton , to appear in the new television show the tale is considered one of trollope 's best works several actresses , including anna chancellor , who made a guest appearance in the last series of downton abbey , juliet stevenson and janet mcteer could all be likely contenders for the role of the snobbish lady arabella . the project is the realisation of a life - long ambition for fellowes , a huge admirer of trollope 's work . he revealed plans for the new drama at a dinner held at the athenaeum club in london on friday night to celebrate the bicentenary of trollope 's birth . fellowes was a speaker at the event . he told the mail on sunday that there was a snobbishness towards trollope in certain quarters and he hoped the adaptation would lead to a flood of other series . ' i think television has just woken up to the fact that there are all these wonderful stories by trollope which have never been done . how much more interesting than the 88th version of pride and prejudice . ' fellowes revealed that many of the characters in downton abbey and his oscar-winning 2001 film gosford park had been inspired by trollope . he said gosford park 's lady trentham and downton 's dowager countess of grantham -- both played by maggie smith -- were very similar to doctor thorne 's lady arabella , and that gosford 's imperious lady sylvia , played by kristin scott thomas , was a ` classic ' from a trollope novel . also at the athenaeum club was fellow trollope fan sir john major . he discovered trollope when he was 13 and likened the author to a ` friend for 60 years ' . in an article in the mail on sunday 's event magazine he wrote : ' i invite others to make his acquaintance . few , if any , will be disappointed . and most -- like the young boy who once rummaged through the library shelves in brixton -- will find a love for life .

            "from the moment jack johnson beat tommy burns to win the world heavyweight title in 1908 , a frenzied search began . while johnson 's victory would n't raise an eyebrow nowadays , it caused consternation in america for one simple reason : johnson was black -- and a black man had never held sport 's greatest prize . racism was rife in america : black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life . as the great boxing pundit bert sugar put it , ` this was the white man 's crown . ( to white america ) , it was as if the white man 's slave had become his master . ' after beating tommy burns in 1908 , jack johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion it is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that johnson 's victory caused . even liberal newspapers , such as the new york times , were openly hostile to the giant texan . it mattered little that johnson was american . his skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white america to find a white challenger -- a ` great white hope ' -- who could unseat the new champion . but little did white america know that it would take over six years before johnson would be defeated , on april 5 , 1915 , 100 years ago on sunday . most had believed johnson would be dispatched quickly . however , he made short work of his first four title defences , his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion stanley ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock johnson down . yet johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and , as soon as he returned to his feet , scored a brutal knockout , uprooting several of ketchel 's teeth in the process . attention immediately turned to finding another ` white hope ' . there seemed an obvious choice : former world heavyweight champion james j jeffries , who had retired undefeated in 1904 . jeffries , who as champion had dodged johnson , was seen as someone who could quickly defeat the title holder and return things to the way they were . things did n't go as planned . six years out of the ring had taken its toll on jeffries and in 1910 johnson stopped the former champion in 15 rounds , further enraging whites who rioted , taking out their anger on blacks who had the temerity to celebrate johnson 's win . as many as 26 black people would be killed by lynch mobs . what made johnson even more unbearable to white america was the way he lived his life . a fun-loving character , johnson dated and married white women , and refused to live according to the social norms of the time . he was intelligent , eloquent and ambitious and saw no reason why his being black should hold him back from doing whatever he wanted . american heavyweight boxer jess willard ( left ) with his manager tom jones in havana , cuba in april 1915 johnson loses his world heavyweight title to willard ( left ) over the course of 26 rounds in havana in 1915 like muhammad ali years later , he was a trailblazer . he suffered dreadful discrimination , death threats and later persecution at the hands of the government . he took most of it in his stride . the same can not be said of his detractors whose efforts to unseat him became increasingly desperate . in 1912 , one opponent , ` fireman ' jim flynn , was disqualified for repeatedly trying to headbutt johnson . things were getting ridiculous , but johnson 's life outside the ring was unravelling . he spent money like it grew on trees and was being investigated by the us government on the spurious charge of abducting his future second wife under what was known as the mann act , a dubious piece of legislation designed to prevent ` white slavery ' . he was found guilty by an all-white jury and sentenced to a year in prison . he fled to canada and then to europe , fighting three times in paris , where he made history by beating ` battling ' jim johnson in the first-ever all-black heavyweight championship bout . next he outpointed american frank moran over 20 rounds , though the purses for the fight were frozen after a dispute . with his money running low and the first world war breaking out in europe , he accepted the challenge of another ` white hope ' from america . his name was jess willard , a 6ft 6in fighter , known as ` the pottawatomie giant . ' to put willard 's size into perspective , the average height of an american man at the time was 5ft 7in . the fight would take place in cuba and was scheduled for 45 three-minute rounds , a hell of a distance given the 40-degree heat on the day . how would johnson , now 37 , handle a challenger four years his junior ? the champion had , quite arrogantly , barely trained for the fight . still , willard was certainly the underdog : his size meant he was not particularly agile and he did not like hurting opponents unless they had hurt him first . johnson dominated the opening 10 rounds but his lack of conditioning soon began to tell . his breathing became heavy , amid the sweltering heat , and willard grew in confidence . the writing was on the wall at the end of round 25 . johnson , sat on his stool , called over fight promoter jack curley . ` jack , go take my wife away ... tell her i 'm awful weak and i want her to leave . ' in the next round willard seized his chance . he faked to throw a left to the body and then swung a mighty overhand right that connected perfectly with johnson 's jaw . johnson slumped to the canvas and took the count flat on his back . it was the victory that white america had been waiting for but was all as it seemed ? action from the world heavyweight title fight between johnson and willard in havana , cuba in 1915 photographs of the knockout appeared to show johnson shielding his eyes from the sun and he would later claim this was because he had deliberately taken a fall . his motivation , johnson said , was a $ 50,000 payout and a promise from the american authorities that he could finally return to his homeland without having to serve his prison sentence . johnson 's ` confession ' was sold for a fee to nat fleischer , the respected founder of the ring magazine . but fleischer never believed johnson , while willard was bitter about johnson 's claim , especially as the victory was his finest hour . ` if he was going to throw the fight i wish he 'd done it sooner , ' willard said . ` it was hotter than hell out there . ' much of the public believed johnson and they had not seen the film of the contest as there was a ban on it being shown . it would take 40 years for the footage to see the light of day . when it did surface , willard was vindicated , the film clearly showing him land a powerful blow . ` i 've waited a long time but at last people are beginning to believe me when i say i that i beat johnson fair and square . ' willard confronted johnson over his claims in 1944 . ' i asked him why he made his false statement , ' willard recalled . ` he just shrugged and gave me that gold-toothed smile of his . jack knew and i knew he was lying . but the fella was desperate for money , so who could blame him . ' johnson would eventually end his exile and continue fighting into the 1930s . tragically he would die in a car crash in 1946 , speeding away from a diner that refused him service on account of his race . willard would lose his world title in only his second defence , suffering an awful beating at the hands of jack dempsey before retiring to his farm in kansas . johnson was defeated after enduring 26 rounds in the sweltering cuban heat , compared to ` hell '\n",

' he did not face police department discipline in the case because the statute of limitations had passed . police commissioners at the time reached a $ 83,000 out of court settlement with the gay man . the sfpd did not respond to a request for comment from daily mail online about whether the incident involved the same jason fox accused in the text message scandal . san francisco public defender jeff adachi said that more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified will need to be reviewed minutes from a san francisco family violence council meeting show that fox was promoted from lieutenant to captain in 2013 . celis was suspended in 2004 after an incident when he tried to use his badge and pay a bribe to get into his wife 's hotel room . wibunsin and several other officers were accused of stealing $ 10,000 while executing a search warrant in 2011 . public defender jeff adachi said he expects more than 1,000 cases where the officers testified to be reviewed . he has called for the department of justice to investigate san francisco 's police as it did with officers in ferguson , missouri , according to kqed .\n",

            "these are the pictures taken by an unforgiving regime of the men , women and children caught trying to escape its suffocating clutches and then forced to re-enact their ordeal for the cameras of the secret police . ` reenactment mfs ' - the ministry for state security better known as the ` stasi ' during the 40 year existence of the east german state - is a new book containing these photos of desperation which the socialist rulers used as evidence in the show trials against those they caught . they were also thought to have been used for training purposes for border guards and trainee agents intended to inculcate in them awareness of the lengths people would go to in order to try to escape the workers ' paradise that was the german democratic republic . foiled : the stasi - east germany 's secret police - forced people to pose for their pictures , showing exactly how they had planned to escape from the german democratic republic humiliation : the families were forced to line up and pose for the pictures , which were used as ` evidence ' lessons : the photographs were also used to train up border guards , so they knew what people might try to do to escape the confines of east germany hidden : these pictures were found in the archives of east germany 's stasi secret police , presumably the clothing of someone who had tried to flee the communist regime but photographer arwed messmer , who discovered the pictures , sees another reason for the pictures of families desperate to escape the grasp of east germany . ` of course when i saw these photos of families for the first time i was reminded of abu ghraib , ' he said , referring to the prison in iraq where american gaolers humiliated their prisoners for amusement and captured the images of their degradation on camera . messmer found the remarkable photos in a box at the stasi archive in berlin , where mile upon mile of yellowing paperwork - the files of the secret policemen which they managed to neither burn or shred in the east german state 's dying hours - now reside . together , they constitute a fascinating if grim epitaph to a nation which erected the berlin wall to hermetically seal in its citizens . one of the photos shows a man sitting in a homemade raft made out of polystyrene slabs , nylon rope , and wooden boards . he was transporting it to the baltic sea near the east german resort of boltenhagen on july 9 , 1981 , when he was apprehended , tried and flung into prison . simple : a picture of a ladder , which some desperate person had used to try to escape to the west creativity : the ingenuity of people trying to escape was remarkable : one picture shows a girl hiding in a gearbox compartment , while others simply show the vehicle in which they tried to make their escape evidence : other pictures , like these blood stained tops , look more like a picture which might be taken by police for use in a court case today another is of a primitive float constructed out of a car tyre inner tube , a fan motor and car battery . the craft was assembled by a man who worked in a factory which made trabant cars . he intended also to sail from boltenhagen to get to the west on june 26 , 1989 . but he was apprehended before he hit the shoreline and also ended up in jail . collection : all the pictures have now been brought together in a book by the photographer arwed messmer one of the more poignant photos shows a young boy standing outside a car with its boot open , his sister forced to lie inside , just as she was found when their car was stopped at checkpoint bravo in berlin as it headed west on september 12 1983 . it is believed the children were sent to a stasi orphanage , their mother arrested . also caught in the cold glare of the stasi photographic lens was an east german family and their west berlin escape helpers , oliver mierendorf and karlheinz hetschold , who tried to smuggle them west in an opel car on september 21 , 1973 . the ingenuity of the people smugglers knew no bounds . one of the photos shows a young girl lying in the gearbox compartment at the front of a peugeot 403 on september 9 , 1965 , as two u.s. soldiers attempted to get her through the border to the west . tunnels , people caught in vans , others caught in car boots as well as models of the stasi hq speak from the pages of the book : silent witnesses to an unforgicing system which killed hundreds and imprisoned thousands more before it imploded in 1989 . messmer said : ` many of these pictures were surely made within the kind of standard crime investigation routine you can find all over the world . ` in these reenactments i suspect that the east german authorities wanted to at least keep up the semblance of the rule of law , by giving state prosecutors visual evidence , even if a later trial verdict was already pretty certain at the time of arrest . ' i would say that the humiliation caused by this form of documentation was more like collateral damage , and that it was accepted as simply part of the process . '\n",

            "( cnn ) this is a difficult but necessary thing to say : incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed african-americans are unlikely to end soon . that 's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a \" moment . \" and it 's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it . this is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis . the peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over . the violent response of police officers to unarmed african-americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as \" race card \" politics and black grievance . but this year 's spate of killings and assaults , from ferguson , missouri , to north charleston , south carolina , to most recently baltimore , are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the african-american community . so what makes now different ? the advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally . as a result , it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed african-americans as has happened in the past . to call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed african-americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it . a true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions . the loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system . how do we face this crisis ? first , we must recognize that there are no quick fixes . the culture of policing in cities such as new york and baltimore has developed over decades . policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house . to subvert that culture will require vigorous , targeted and consistent training . that training must include a focus on managing implicit bias , encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community , especially young people . training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles . president barack obama is right when he reminds us that policing , like education , is a function of state and local government . and it 's true that his options are limited . and yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities . by conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards . in contrast , while the department of justice provides more than $ 1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country , those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training , data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus . also , the civil rights division of the justice department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination . such investigations doubled to more than 20 under attorney general eric holder , but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country , this is woefully inadequate . it 's been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination . the results in places such as seattle and cincinnati , where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices , are promising . but the $ 12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance . much has been made of rogue police officers , \" bad apples \" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system . but the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline , punish and , where appropriate , remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch . there must be zero tolerance for racism , brutality and corruption in police departments . making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts . yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve , we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality . ultimately , the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally , including who we decide to recruit to serve . former baltimore police commissioner leonard hamm , for example , has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives . that thinking reflects a spirit of adventure , he told me , rather than a spirit of service . hamm is right -- policing is , at its core , a service profession . those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness , courage and smarts , but also integrity , maturity , empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve . a national crisis requires a national response , and that means that federal , state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality . until we see that kind of wholesale engagement , the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance .\n",

' cook , who made it perfectly clear last year that he did not want pietersen in his side again even before his bitter autobiography that appeared to sever all ties with england , concurred with his coach . pietersen ( left ) controversially celebrated australia 's world cup win with his friends james faulkner yorkshire opener adam lyth ( centre ) will get a chance to impress on the west indies tour ` contrary to what you may read in the media i 'm a long way away from that decision . it 's down to paul downton , tom harrison and colin graves about kevin , it 's not down to us , ' said an england captain who was dropped from the one-day side after of a world cup where england failed to negotiate the group stage . ` we 've got 16 guys going to west indies who are desperate to start turning round english cricket from what 's happened over the last three months . ` we need to get back to winning ways and it 's about a brand of cricket and trying to win this series . it 's about 16 guys and the support staff . the ecb will have to deal with everything else . ' cook spoke in abu dhabi last month where he played for mcc against yorkshire of his anger at frustration at missing out on the world cup . on thursday he was more conciliatory , particularly towards the coach who dropped him . ` i have known mooresey for years and i love working with him , ' said cook . ` i have had time away and the thing i 'm looking forward to most is leading england again in that first test . from my point of view it is all about that . ` it 's been a different couple of months to what i thought i was going to have before christmas . every cloud has a huge silver lining and spending three months at home has been fantastic if i 'm being honest with you . durham fast bowler mark wood is another new face in england 's test squad ` i 've been living a normal life again which i have n't had for a long time and it 's been great spending time with family and friends and being at home . from that point of view it 's been really refreshing and enjoyable . a lot has gone on since that last win against india at the oval when we had three outstanding test matches to come back from one down in that series . ` a lot has happened since and to say we can get back straight away is going to be a challenge and it 's up to the players and the leadership to try and do that because as i say , in the last three tests we played we played some good cricket . ' moores would not go as far as to say he regretted the decision to drop cook and make eoin morgan one-day captain ahead of the world cup . ` we can look back at everything . me and cooky have spoken and i 've gone through a lot with alastair . he was disappointed not to go , it did n't work out , but we 've got to look forward now . we can go no further than the next five weeks . ` i really think we 've got to keep it simple . there 's been a lot of noise around english cricket and a lot of emotion which is understandable but i think now we 've got 16 players who are going to the west indies under alastair and we 've got to go and try to play some really good cricket . ' new chairman graves , who has heaped pressure on england by encouraging pietersen to return to county cricket , caused another stir when he called west indies mediocre and said there would be an inquiry if england failed to win . and moores acknowledged that jobs are on the line in the caribbean . both cook and moores were keen to talk about the squad and not about pietersen ` from my point of view it 's not about the coach . it 's about the players , it 's about winning and it 's about english cricket . we 've got a very committed bunch of players and support staff who desperately want to win for england . so i 'm going no further than the next five weeks when we 've got three tests against tough opposition . if we do well we 'll get some momentum going into what is a very big summer . so that 's got to be the focus , on playing the right sort of cricket because that 's what the fans want . but has he been given any assurance over his position and those of others ? ` no , it does n't work like that , ' said moores . ` i think we all know we 're in a results business . tom harrison and colin graves have come in and tom has been great since he 's been here . for me i 'm just focusing on what 's in front of us . ` for me and alastair it 's pretty clear . we 've got some new players coming in and we 've got jonathan trott coming back . we 've got to make sure that the side moulds quickly . we 've got a couple of practice games and we go straight into the test series and we do n't need to go any further than that . ' he knows , though , that his job will probably not go any further than the west indies if england fail to win . and pietersen will be a constant presence in the background piling on the pressure . experienced batsman jonathan trott returns to the side after suffering from situational anxiety\n",

            "the podium girl is the centre of a ` sexism storm ' after lewis hamilton sprayed champagne in her face said she was n't offended by his stunt - and was just doing her job . the british formula 1 racer drew criticism from around the world when he aimed the fizz directly as the face of 23-year-old grid girl liu siying , who was pictured looking less than impressed . but the shanghai institute of visual art graduate , who was a ` podium girl ' at the chinese grand prix , said she did n't think much about the incident and was n't annoyed . liu siying was pictured grimacing as lewis hamilton sprayed champagne at her face after winning the race sexism campaigners called hamilton 's behaviour ` selfish ' but siying said she did not think too much about it the hostess said : ' i was told by my employer to stand on the podium , and that 's what i did ' ` it lasted for only one or two seconds , and i did not think too much about it at all , ' miss siying told the shanghai daily . ' i think some foreign media are more sensitive about the topic compared to local media . ' i was just told by my employer to stand on the podium , and that 's what i did . ' miss siying had asked to work as a podium model on the stage of the chinese grand prix in shanghai because she was a fan of finnish driver kimi raikkonen . after the incident on sunday , object , a campaign group against sexism , condemned the behaviour of the driver as ` selfish and inconsiderate ' and called on hamilton to apologise to the graduate . others have called the driving ace an 'em barrassment to the uk ' , while another said his actions showed that he was an ` ignorant clown ' . it 's not the first time racing ace lewis hamilton has sprayed a grid girl with bubbly - he 's also done it after winning the spanish grand prix and even at the austrian grand prix , where he lost out on the top spot after seeing the pictures the chief executive of campaign group object asked for hamilton to apologise speaking on monday , roz hardie , chief executive of object said miss siying would have had ittle choice but to ` stand there and take it ' . she said : ` the photographs appear to show that the woman is not just being splashed , but that the champagne is being very specifically directed into her face , which does not look like a voluntary piece of horseplay on her part . ` if this if the case we think lewis hamilton should apologise for his actions and think carefully about how he behaves in the future . for most people , it would be apparent that she is not enjoying it . ` it is surely a very difficult position to be a grid girl and she would have had little option but to stand there and take it . that is something of which he should be aware . but instead , he appears to have abused her position . ` it 's unfortunate that a great victory has been marred by what appears to be selfish and inconsiderate behaviour . ' ms hardie added that the episode highlighted the more general issue of women being viewed as sexual objects in the motoring world . hamilton also sprayed a hostess at montmelo after winning the spanish grand prix at circuit de catalunya she said : ` motor racing appears to unnecessarily portray women as sexualised objects and that probably makes it even harder for the women to stand up for themselves . we would hope people in the industry would be respectful to these women . on twitter , hamilton was described as a ` bully ' and ` disgusting ' . another user simply said : ` man please stop spraying champagne on the podium ladies . they do n't like it ' , while one outraged user said he was a ` scumbag - an embarrassment to uk ' . another wrote : ` have a bit more respect for the ladies please . spraying champagne in her face was out of order #child #idiot . ' and one tweeted : ` shame on you f1 and lewis hamilton for disgraceful treatment of women during champagne celebration #sexism . ' it is not the first time the racing icon has whipped out his victory move . he celebrated in a similar fashion after winning spanish grand prix last year , which was his fourth consecutive win in a row and the one that finally put him on top of the world championship table . and although he lost the austrian grand prix to teammate nico rosberg , he did n't shy away from popping the cork directly at a hostess . the 30-year-old was even asked to demonstrate his champagne skills on graham norton 's talk show in 2013 . but not everyone was offended by his behaviour . many found his actions amusing , while another said : ' i can think of worse things to happen at work than getting sprayed in the face with champagne by @lewishamilton . hamilton controlled the contest in shanghai to seal his second victory in three races and extend his lead at the summit of the formula one world championship yesterday . but it was n't all smiles at yesterday 's race after a serious feud was sparked between hamilton and his teammate nico rosberg , following a press conference . it was n't all smiles after a serious feud was sparked between hamilton and his teammate nico rosberg the mercedes driver poses with his trophy and champagne bottle on the podium after winning on sunday his mercedes partner accused him of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under unnecessary pressure from ferrari 's sebastian vettel . with the top three drivers covered by only 3.5 seconds ahead of the final round of pit-stops , rosberg reported on the radio that ` lewis is driving very slowly . tell him to speed up . ' hamilton , seemingly protecting his tyres , was given the hurry-up by mercedes and both he and rosberg eventually emerged from their final pit-stop first and second with vettel third . the world champion , sitting beside his teammate , told the press conference yesterday : ' i was n't controlling his race , i was controlling my own race . ` my goal was to look after my car . i had no real threat from nico throughout the whole race . ' a visibly angry rosberg replied : ` it 's just now interesting to hear from you lewis that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front when that was compromising my race . nico rosberg ( left ) accused hamilton of severely compromising his strategy and leaving him under pressure ` driving slower than was maybe necessary in the beginning of the stint meant sebastian was close to me and it opened up the opportunity for sebastian to try an early pit stop to try and jump me and then i had to cover him . ` it was unnecessarily close with sebastian as a result , and also it cost me a lot of race time because i had to cover him . then my tyres died at the end of the race because my stint was just so much longer , so i 'm unhappy about that . ' the spat has reopened the wounds from last year when both men tried to out-manoeuvre , and at times out-pysch one another as their battle for the title unfolded . it culminated in the pair colliding with one another in the belgian grand prix , resulting in rosberg being reprimanded and sanctioned by the team . this proved to be a turning point in the championship as hamilton went on to dominate the closing races en route to taking his second crown .\n",

            "( cnn ) more than 22 months ago , the body of odin lloyd was found in an industrial park in north attleboro , massachusetts . lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste . the semipro football player for the boston bandits was 27 . days after he was found dead , then-nfl star aaron hernandez was arrested and charged with murder . testimony in the case against hernandez began in january . on wednesday , a fall river , massachusetts , jury -- after deliberating 35 hours over the course of seven days -- found the former new england patriots tight end guilty of first-degree murder , which carries a penalty of life without parole , as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of ammunition . hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide . he has pleaded not guilty . just two years ago , he was one of the nfl 's most promising tight ends , inking a $ 40-million contract extension with the new england patriots . friends and fans alike wondered : how could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder ? long before hernandez made national headlines , he was a standout athlete in bristol , connecticut , who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty . \" i do n't think there was another family that was more familiar in bristol , \" bob montgomery , who covers high school sports for the bristol press , told cnn . the young hernandez was the \" golden boy , \" playing football , basketball and running track , following in the footsteps of his uncle , older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community . hernandez 's father constantly pushed his son , requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends . \" i saw a closeness with them that i 'd never seen before , \" montgomery said of the relationship between hernandez and his father . but his father , the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored , died from complications after a routine surgery . hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in january 2007 to join the university of florida gators , and trouble seemed to follow . in just his first semester , a police report says , hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant , sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum . the following fall , there was a shooting near a local club . police reports linked hernandez and several other university of florida football players to an argument in the parking lot . hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police , and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel . at the time , hernandez 's mother told the orlando sentinel newspaper , \" i know he was at the club , but he never saw any shooting . \" the case remains open , and no one has been charged . hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana , an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year . trying to put the alleged drug use behind him , hernandez wrote a letter to the patriots director of personnel . \" if you draft me as a member of the new england patriots , i will willfully submit to a biweekly drug test throughout my rookie season . ... in addition , i will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test , \" he wrote , according to the boston globe . before the draft , hernandez was expected to be a first - or second-round pick . he was passed over until the fourth round , when the patriots selected him . by the end of his second season , he was a bona fide star , landing the $ 40 million contract extension . less than a year after signing the deal , however , the patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with lloyd 's murder . when odin lloyd pulled up in a black chevrolet suburban , boston bandits coach mike branch thought something was out of place . lloyd did n't own a car . aaron hernandez case : who 's who ? branch had his suspicions , but he could n't get answers . lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night . \" he said he was at the club with mr. hernandez , and that they were partying and he had a good time , and that mr. hernandez spent a good amount of money , \" branch recalled . lloyd said hernandez spent about $ 10,000 that night . lloyd 's friends say he was n't a big partier . he was more passionate about football and family . lloyd was dating shaneah jenkins , the link between the young man who dreamed of the nfl and the all-american who made it . jenkins is the younger sister of shayanna , who 's engaged to hernandez and is the mother of his little girl . on june 16 , 2013 , lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban , which police later learned was rented by hernandez . daryl hodge was with lloyd when he said lloyd got a text from hernandez , asking to hang out later that night . as they parted ways , lloyd told hodge he 'd see him later . the next day , lloyd 's body was found . prosecutors say lloyd was last seen with hernandez and hernandez 's two associates , carlos ortiz and ernest wallace , around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver nissan altima . surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. . at the same time , chilling text messages from lloyd 's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with \" nfl , \" adding , \" just so u know . \" between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. , workers nearby reported hearing gunshots . at 3:29 , a camera showed an altima pulling into hernandez 's driveway , about a half a mile from the death scene . three people got out of the car , and lloyd was not one of them . nine days later , hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges . in april 2014 , ortiz and wallace were also charged in lloyd 's slaying . they , too , pleaded not guilty . prosecutors say the three men were to be tried in a joint venture , a legal term that means it 's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in lloyd 's murder . as the trial for the death of lloyd neared , lawyers began arguing about evidence , including cell phones and text messages . some rulings were victories for the defense . the jury would n't see the text lloyd sent to his sister , telling her he was with \" nfl . \" the judge ruled it hearsay and said the state had n't proven lloyd believed his life was in danger . jurors also did n't hear anything about what happened in boston on july 16 , 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where hernandez had been . the judge agreed with defense lawyers that it 's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to lloyd 's murder . investigators allege hernandez shot and killed daniel abreu and safiro furtado because one of the men bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink . district attorney patrick haggan described the scene in a massachusetts courtroom in may , saying hernandez became \" angered and increasingly agitated , particularly after mr. abreu smiled and did not apologize . \" prosecutors : bump , spilled drink led to double homicide hernandez 's friend tried to calm him down , and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street , the prosecutor said . court documents identify that friend as alexander bradley , who would go on to accuse hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later . after leaving the second nightclub , hernandez and the friend returned to their suv and pulled over on a nearby street where hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block , haggan said . hernandez began trailing abreu , furtado and three of their friends in his suv , authorities said . he then pulled up to the victims ' car at a red light and leaned out the driver 's side window with a loaded revolver , haggan told the court . hernandez allegedly said , \" yo , what 's up now , \" followed by a racial slur , and fired at least five rounds from a .38 - caliber revolver , haggan said . abreu , the driver , was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest . furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds , including one to the head , haggan said . hernandez was charged in the double homicide in may , and he pleaded not guilty . investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of lloyd . cnn 's laura dolan , kristi ramsay and michelle rozsa contributed to this report .\n",

' he added that the animals , which measure two to three metres in length , could have been trying to avoid predators like killer whales and come too close to the shore . however , despite attempts to reassure the public , social media sites like twitter have been ablaze with rumours of an impending earthquake . one twitter user wrote : ` is the next one coming ? be ready for a quake . ' the whales first began to appear on the beach last week but officials said they had discovered eight more bodies today . local residents had rushed to the beaches with buckets and towels in an attempt to help keep the marine mammals alive . scientists are still investigating what caused the whales to become stranded on the beaches of hokota city local resident used buckets of water in an attempt to keep the melon-headed whales alive on the beaches officials have spent the weekend removing and buring the dead melon-headed whales after they stranded however , almost all of the animals have now died although a few were returned to the ocean . the strandings in 2011 before the magnitude 9 earthquake off the coast of japan is not the first association of whale strandings with tectonic activity . around 100 pilot whales died in a mass stranding on a remote beach in new zealand just two days before a large earthquake hit christchurch in 2011 . the 2004 boxing day earthquake in the indian ocean that also triggered a devastating tsunami also saw 170 whales stranded on beaches in australia and new zealand in the days before . those whales that survived were taken back out to sea by the japan coast guard to return them to the ocean japan coast guard personnel managed to return some of the whales back to the sea the whales were stranded on two beaches close to hokota city around 60 miles north of tokyo according to the us geological survey , which monitors tremors around the world , there was a small magnitude 5.3 earthquake 157 miles ( 252km ) off the coast of namie , japan . quakes of this size are relatively common along the fault line . however , researchers have found it is possible detect tiny pulses in the earth 's magnetic field in the areas around the epicentre of earthquakes in the weeks before they occur . researchers at san jose state university have been developing new techniques to use these pulses to predict earthquakes using highly sensitive magnetometres . however , it is not know if whales have the ability to detect such tiny fluctuations . tadasu yamada , a senior researcher at the national museum of nature and science , said investigations were still ongoing into what caused the whales to strand in hokato . he told public broadcaster nhk : ` we do n't see any immediate signs of diseases on their bodies , such as cancer . ` we want to figure out what killed these animals . ' residents struggled to return the whales to the sea after the mammals became exhausted in the shallow water once stranded , the animals are vulnerable to dehydration and sunburn until rescuers can use the high tide to move their massive weight back into deeper water . efforts to save the dolphins stood in marked contrast to the global view of japan and its relationship with cetaceans . despite international opprobrium , japan hunts minke and pilot whales off its coast , and has for many years also pursued the mammals in the antarctic ocean , where it takes advantage of a scientific exemption to an international moratorium on whaling . it has never made a secret of the fact that meat from the animals is consumed . a united nations court ruled last year that the antarctic hunt was a commercial venture masquerading as research , prompting tokyo to suspend operations , but it vowed to redesign the programme to make it more scientific . the international whaling commission 's ( iwc ) panel of experts said today that it opposed japan 's proposal for its scientific research whaling programme , saying it did not demonstrate a need for killing whales .\n",

' i feel good , ' he added . ` all i want to do is go fishing and ride my bike and spend time with sandy and do a little gardening . ' ` hopefully everything is going to be like it used to be . ' he added that he had been riding a motorcycle ever since his release and complained that california roads had gotten bumpier during his years behind bars . mugshot : hanline was convicted of murder for the fatal shooting of truck driver j.t. mcgarr in 1980 after decades behind bars , hanline was also coming to terms with 21st century living and talked about ` buck rogers ' gadgets such as cellphones . ` gas is n't 32 cents and a pack of cigarettes is n't 30 cents , ' he said . ` it 's a whole new ball game . ' hanline was in his early thirties when he was charged with killing friend , ventura resident j.t. mcgarry in 1978 . he said he kept waiting for justice to prevail but had no idea that he would spent the next 36 years in prison . ` when i first got arrested , i figured it might take a year or two to get this all straightened around but not 36 , ' he said , including two years he spent in jail after his arrest but before his conviction . he added : ' i never believed i 'd spend the rest of my life in prison , but man , 36 years is a long , long time . ' mcgarry , a ventura resident who also used the name michael mathers , dealt in drugs and ran motorcycle-oriented swap meets for the publishers of easyriders magazine , according to court papers . he went missing on november 10 , 1978 , and was found shot to death two days later by a highway . hanline , who was romantically involved with mcgarry 's ex-girlfriend , was arrested on an unrelated charge that month after traveling to northern california and using mcgarry 's credit card , court papers stated . he was charged with murder by prosecutors who suggested his motive was jealousy over mcgarry 's on-again , off-again relationship with the ex-girlfriend . but more than three decades after he was incarcerated , it emerged that crucial dna analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial the evidence proved that hanline was innocent and the longest-serving wrongfully imprisoned inmate in californian history was finally released last november with charges only officially dropped yesterday hanline 's then-girlfriend , mary bischoff , was granted immunity and was a key witness at his trial . she testified that mcgarry had skimmed thousands of dollars from motorcycle swap meets and that hanline had threatened to ` blow his brains out .

' a second tweet pointed out how the pilots were in violation of the ` safe cockpit ' rules and are subject to a # 260 fine , at the very least . the safety breach comes amid heightened concerns over aviation security after the germanwings airliner crash in which all 150 people on board died when the plane 's co-pilot deliberately flew the airbus jet into the ground . captain : turan , pictured right , challenges for the ball during the game last week la liga star : turan plays in midfield for atletico madrid on saturday , in a 2-0 win over cordoba\n",
